//! The loro oplog, persisted (#173).
//!
//! `<name>.daw` is the readable source of truth and the project is a
//! loro CRDT doc in memory. The hole that forces this module: if the
//! CRDT exists only in memory, every load builds a fresh doc from text
//! and throws away all causality — so two people who each edit offline
//! and save their own `.daw` share no history, reconciling them
//! degrades to text merging, and the CRDT buys nothing the moment it
//! touches disk.
//!
//! So the oplog goes into `objects/`, where it fits exactly: large,
//! binary, append-only, immutable, content-addressed.
//!
//! ## Hand edits win
//!
//! The manifest is hand-editable, and that is a stated requirement. An
//! oplog built from text that has since been edited by hand is a *stale
//! log*: replaying it would resurrect the state the human just
//! overwrote. So the hash of the `.daw` the oplog was built from is
//! stored beside it, and on load a mismatch **discards the oplog and
//! starts fresh history from the text**.
//!
//! The cost is that hand-editing forfeits offline merge for that
//! project. That is the acceptable side of the trade: losing merge
//! history is recoverable, silently losing an edit somebody typed is
//! not. The better long-term answer is a CLI that applies scripted
//! edits *through* the CRDT, which is why this is a trade rather than a
//! design.
