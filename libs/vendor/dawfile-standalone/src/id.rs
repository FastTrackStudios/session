//! Stable identity.
//!
//! The hard requirement from
//! [#155](https://github.com/FastTrackStudios/FastTrackStudio/issues/155):
//! every entity carries a stable unique id, and **nothing is ever referenced
//! by array index or position**. This module is where that lives.
//!
//! Two id kinds, and they are not interchangeable:
//!
//! - [`EntityId`] names a *thing in the document* — a track, an item, a take,
//!   an envelope, a marker, a template. It is stable for the life of the
//!   entity and survives reordering, save/load and (later) CRDT merge.
//! - [`ObjectId`] names *bytes* — a content hash into `objects/`. Two
//!   machines that produce the same bytes necessarily produce the same
//!   `ObjectId`, which is why large data cannot conflict on sync.
//!
//! ## What is deliberately *not* an entity
//!
//! Envelope points, tempo points and stretch markers carry no id. They are
//! values inside one owner's ordered list, nothing outside that list ever
//! refers to one, and giving each of an envelope's several thousand points a
//! UUID would wreck the readability that is the whole point of the format.
//! Their merge identity comes from loro's list CRDT at the oplog layer
//! (#173), not from the text.
//!
//! ## Index fields are a cache, never a reference
//!
//! `daw_proto`'s `Track::index`, `Item::index`, `Take::index` and
//! `EnvelopePoint::index` exist because the facade's callers want them. In a
//! `.daw` document they are **derived**: recomputed from list position by
//! [`crate::DawDocument::reindex`] on every load and after every structural
//! edit. Nothing in the format reads them to find anything.
