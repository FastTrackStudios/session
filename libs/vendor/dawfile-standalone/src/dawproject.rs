//! DAWproject as an **interop** target.
//!
//! Native is ours (`<name>.daw`); DAWproject is how a session reaches
//! Bitwig, Cubase or Studio One. It was seriously considered as the
//! native format and rejected on one fact: a `.dawproject` is a ZIP,
//! which is the worst possible dedup target — compressed, monolithic,
//! and wholly rewritten on any change, in direct conflict with the
//! object store that makes autosave cheap.
//!
//! As interop it is nearly free, because `dawfile-dawproject` already
//! reads *and* writes and its modelled set lines up with ours.
//!
//! ## What crosses, and what does not
//!
//! Transport, the track hierarchy and mixer state cross both ways.
//!
//! **Editor state does not, and cannot.** DAWproject has no home for it,
//! so a round trip out to Cubase and back silently drops mode
//! corrections, lane layout and the generated envelopes. That is
//! accepted rather than solved (#157), and it is the reason the native
//! format exists at all.
//!
//! **FX chains do not.** They are opaque hash-named blobs on our side
//! and typed devices on theirs; carrying bytes across would produce a
//! file that claims plugin state it cannot honour.
//!
//! **Item volume automation does cross, but flattened.** Scenario 1 of
//! #149 generates four source envelopes — gating, compression,
//! sibilance, de-breathing — composited into the item's one volume
//! envelope. DAWproject has one gain expression per lane and no home
//! for the four, exactly as REAPER's item chunk has one `VOLENV`. So
//! the *composite* crosses and the sources stay in the `.daw`.
//!
//! That is a real limit, and the important part is that it is not
//! silent: a mix handed to Cubase keeps its volume ride, and the four
//! it was built from are simply not there to edit.
//!
//! **An item ride is scoped to its item, and overlapping items do not
//! cross at all.** Folding item envelopes into a track lane is only
//! sound where the items are disjoint, which a comped vocal — the exact
//! material scenario 1 is built on — is not:
//!
//! - *Overlapping items export no lane for that track.* Two composites
//!   concatenated into one curve alternate between two different rides.
//!   Refusing follows the same rule as an ambiguous item: this module
//!   prefers "does not cross" over "quietly wrong".
//! - *A gap returns to unity.* A track lane holds its last value until
//!   the next point, so an item that ends ducked would attenuate the
//!   silence behind it and the next phrase's attack. Each item's ride
//!   ends with a unity point at the item's end — except where the next
//!   item abuts exactly, where such a point would collide with that
//!   item's first.
