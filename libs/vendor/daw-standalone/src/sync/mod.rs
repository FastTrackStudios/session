//! Sync trait implementation for the standalone backend.
//!
//! This module implements `daw_proto::*` traits with an in-memory state
//! store. It is intended for tests and non-REAPER hosts. The state lives behind
//! a single `std::sync::Mutex` (this is non-realtime control state — std mutex
//! is fine, this is not the audio path).
//!
//! The sync state here is independent from the older async services in this
//! crate (`StandaloneTransport`, `StandaloneRegion`, etc.). Sharing the storage
//! across both API styles would be valuable but is left for a follow-up; the
//! async services have their own per-service locks and entry points and would
//! need broader surgery to converge.
