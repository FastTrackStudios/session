//! Service surface for `Standalone` — declared as [`architect::Services`].
//!
//! Mirrors `daw-reaper`'s [`Reaper`](daw_reaper::Reaper) services bundle so an
//! in-process `Daw` client can speak to Standalone exactly like it does to
//! REAPER. Only domains with real (non-stub) impls are listed; `midi`, `fx`,
//! `live_midi`, `automation`, `batch` are intentionally omitted until Standalone
//! grows real implementations (calls into those domains via the RPC client
//! will fail with a routing error — same as any missing service).
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use architect::Services;
//! use daw_standalone::Standalone;
//!
//! let router = Standalone::new().into_router();
//! ```
