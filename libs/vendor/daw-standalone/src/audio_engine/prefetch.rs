//! Media read-ahead worker — REAPER's "media buffering" thread.
//!
//! Streaming playback reads PCM through `mmap`; a page the kernel
//! hasn't cached yet means a **page fault inside the audio callback**
//! — instant on an SSD, a multi-millisecond stall (= audible glitch)
//! on cold USB / network media. This worker walks the items around
//! the playhead a few times a second and `madvise(WillNeed)`s the
//! next few seconds of source audio so the kernel has the pages warm
//! before the callback touches them.
//!
//! Native-only by construction (threads + mmap); WASM gets its audio
//! via `AudioSource::Memory` where there is nothing to prefetch.
