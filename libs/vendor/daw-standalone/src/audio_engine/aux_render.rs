//! Post-render aux hook: lets a host mix extra audio (click track,
//! count-in voices, section guide, …) into the engine's output after
//! the project block is rendered.
//!
//! Project-mode engines ([`AudioEngine::attached_to`] /
//! [`AudioEngine::with_project`]) invoke the installed [`AuxRenderer`]
//! once per audio callback with:
//!
//! - an **interleaved** f32 buffer (`clock.channels` samples per frame)
//!   already containing the rendered project block — the hook ADDS its
//!   signal into it (buffer is later converted to the device format);
//! - an [`AuxClock`] snapshot of the transport at the first frame of
//!   the block (position in seconds AND beats, tempo, time signature),
//!   derived from the project's tempo map + transport state.
//!
//! The hook is also called while the transport is stopped
//! (`clock.playing == false`, zeroed buffer) so voice tails can flush.
//!
//! Realtime rules: the engine keeps the hook behind a mutex that the
//! audio callback only `try_lock`s — installing/replacing a hook never
//! blocks the audio thread (the hook is skipped for that block under
//! contention). The hook itself must be allocation-free and must not
//! block.
