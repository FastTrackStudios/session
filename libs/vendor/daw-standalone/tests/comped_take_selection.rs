//! A comped item plays the take REAPER marked `SEL`, not an empty lane slot.
//!
//! Built from a real item in `set in stone` (Crescendum), where a tom
//! trigger track had been comped. REAPER writes an empty comp-lane slot as
//! `TAKE NULL` — it occupies a take *index*, exactly as REAPER counts takes
//! — and marks the active take `TAKE SEL`. Such an item has no inline first
//! take, so it carries no item-level `GUID`.
//!
//! Resolving the active take by that missing GUID found nothing and fell
//! back to index 0, which is a null slot. The item then reported an `Empty`
//! active take, and every consumer that keeps only audio dropped it: the
//! trigger tracks composed to 1.3% non-zero at -66 dBFS while their source
//! files were full 317-second recordings, which read as "the trigger tracks
//! hold no audio".
