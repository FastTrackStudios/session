# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd onboard` to get started.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --status in_progress  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

## btca — Source Code Search

Use **btca** to query the actual source code of key dependencies before implementing features or debugging.

```bash
btca ask -r <resource> -q "your question"
btca resources   # list all available resources
```

### Relevant Resources

| Resource | Repo | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `facet` | facet-rs/facet | Rust reflection — shapes, derive macros, serialization |
| `roam` | bearcove/roam | RPC service framework — service traits, streaming, SHM |
| `moire` | bearcove/moire | Instrumentation — task spawning, sync primitives |

## Before you push: `just ci`

**Run `just ci` and get a green run before every push.** It runs exactly
what `.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs, in the same order — lockfile
drift, `cargo fmt --check`, the flow verification gate, the web tailwind
sheet, `cargo check --workspace`, `cargo nextest run --workspace` — and
stops at the first failure, because CI does too and a later step built
on a broken one tells you nothing.

`just ci <step>` starts from a step when you have already passed the
cheap ones and are iterating: `lockfile`, `fmt`, `flows`, `tailwind`,
`check`, `nextest`.

A full run is a few minutes against a warm `target/`. A red CI round
trip is far longer, and on a shared self-hosted runner it blocks
everyone else's checks while it fails.
