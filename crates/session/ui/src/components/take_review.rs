//! The take review panel — rate what you just played, before the next one.
//!
//! One of these in front of every player: a tablet on a mic stand, the
//! pass they just finished drawn across it, and four buttons. The whole
//! interaction has to survive being done with one hand, in the seconds
//! between somebody saying "again" and the count-in — so everything
//! here is big, nothing is a menu, and the only typing is optional.
//!
//! The model is `session_proto::review`; this draws it. What a mark MEANS —
//! that the worst verdict wins, that a stretch and a whole take are the
//! same kind of thing, that re-rating corrects rather than accumulates
//! — is decided there and tested without a browser.
//!
//! # Why the waveform is one shape for many tracks
//!
//! The drummer has eight microphones and does not want eight waveforms.
//! What they want is the shape of what they played, which is the
//! consolidation of their own tracks — the same thing the arrangement's
//! folder preview draws for a collapsed folder. So the peaks handed in
//! here are already summed: this component takes ONE envelope and never
//! knows how many tracks made it.
