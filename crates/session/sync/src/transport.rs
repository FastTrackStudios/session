//! Shared transport: one play button for everyone.
//!
//! Two modes, chosen per session:
//!
//! - **Independent** — the doc is shared, the transport is not. Everyone
//!   runs their own engine and plays what they need to hear; the others'
//!   play cursors are ghosts (see `presence::PlayState`).
//! - **Shared** — one transport. Whoever presses play, everyone plays,
//!   from the same place, at the same moment.
//!
//! The shared transport is ONE presence entry, [`KEY`], that anyone may
//! write: last writer wins, which is what a play button pressed by two
//! people at once should do. It says where the song was at a moment of
//! the *shared clock*, so a peer that hears about it late still starts in
//! the right place — [`ClockSync`] maps this machine's clock onto it.
//! Each peer's [`Follower`] turns the entry into what its own engine must
//! do, and keeps it there: a peer that drifts is nudged back.
//!
//! [`TransportSync`] is the whole of it for one peer — what an app drives:
//! it is told when someone pressed something HERE ([`TransportSync::pressed`])
//! and what the presence holds ([`TransportSync::remote`]), and each tick
//! says what to publish and what the engine must do. What it guarantees:
//!
//! - **A press here wins until a newer one arrives.** Entries are ordered
//!   by `(seq, by)`; an older one — including the entry this peer's own
//!   press replaced, still in the presence until its write comes back — is
//!   never adopted, so it cannot undo the press.
//! - **A press is what it did.** The entry published is the engine's state
//!   once the press has landed (a moment later), not a guess at what the
//!   button meant — play, stop, a seek, a jump home, another song.
//! - **Commands settle.** After the engine is told something, it is given
//!   a moment to do it before it is judged again — no second Play while
//!   the first is still starting, and a song switch (which moves the audio
//!   device) is asked for once, not every tick.
