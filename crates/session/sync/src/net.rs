//! Sharing a session over vox: one peer hosts, the others join.
//!
//! Built on architect's `crdt::sync`: the host serves `DocSync` (the doc)
//! and `DocPresence` (who is doing what) for one session id; each joiner
//! holds both calls open for as long as it is connected. The transport is
//! whatever carries vox — iroh between native peers (`architect::iroh_link`),
//! a WebSocket from a browser, an in-process link in tests. It is hub and
//! spoke through the host, which is also a participant: its own engine
//! edits the very doc it serves.
