//! The live session as a Loro CRDT document.
//!
//! Everyone in a session edits the same [`SessionDoc`]. Each replica is
//! the source of truth for its own engine: local edits are read back
//! from the engine as a [`SessionModel`] and reconciled into the doc
//! ([`SessionDoc::write`]); remote edits arrive as Loro updates, and
//! [`diff`] between the model the engine last showed and the doc's new
//! one says what the engine must do. Concurrent edits merge field by
//! field, and the doc keeps the whole history.
//!
//! The schema, model and diff are engine- and transport-free. The
//! `engine` feature adds the bridge to a daw project (daw-standalone
//! in-process, or REAPER), through `daw_control`.
