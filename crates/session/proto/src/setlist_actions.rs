//! Setlist build / demo / diagnostics — REAPER-facing action contract.
//!
//! The trait only; `session::setlist_actions::SetlistActionsImpl<D>` is
//! the implementation. Same split as `track_manager` / `playback` /
//! `mode`.
//!
//! Namespace is `FTS_SESSION` (not the macro's trait-derived default
//! `SETLIST`) so generated ids match the REAPER named-command
//! convention already in use — `FTS_SESSION_BUILD_SETLIST` etc.
