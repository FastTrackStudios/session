//! Guide track generation — REAPER-facing action contract.
//!
//! The trait only; `session::guide` is the implementation.
//!
//! Stamping the guide as MIDI is the authoring counterpart to playing it.
//! `session_guide`'s engine renders count-in and section cues as audio
//! live from a block clock; these actions write the same schedule into
//! the project as notes on the Click / Count / Guide tracks, so the guide
//! becomes material you can see, edit, and drive an external sampler
//! with — including the FTS Guide plugin.
//!
//! Both come from one `CueSchedule`, so what gets stamped and what gets
//! played can't drift.

/// Generate the Click / Count / Guide tracks for the current project's
/// song.

/// `#[action(undo)]` on everything that writes: the backend brackets each
/// in a single host undo block, so one keystroke undoes a whole stamp
/// rather than several hundred individual note insertions.
///
/// Every generator is idempotent — it clears its own tracks over the
/// song's span before writing, so re-running after editing sections
/// replaces rather than layers.
