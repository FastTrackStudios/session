//! Rating takes, while the band is still playing.
//!
//! The room is tracking. A pass ends, and for the next thirty seconds
//! everybody knows something the session will otherwise forget: that
//! one was the best so far, the second chorus fell apart, the fill
//! going into the bridge was the one. Thirty seconds later the next
//! pass starts and all of it is gone — and at mixdown somebody listens
//! to fourteen takes of the same song trying to rediscover what six
//! people already knew at the time.
//!
//! So this is the model behind a review screen on a tablet in front of
//! each player: a pass, a verdict, and — because "it was great except
//! for the second chorus" is the common case — marks on RANGES of it.
//!
//! # A take here is a PASS, not a DAW take
//!
//! REAPER's take is one recording on one track. What a band means by
//! "that take" is everybody's recording of one run at the song, which
//! is a span of session time with items on twenty tracks under it. That
//! is what a [`Pass`] is, and it is why a rating is not a property of
//! an item.
//!
//! # Why every performer rates separately
//!
//! Because they disagree, and the disagreement is the useful part. The
//! drummer's "amazing" and the singer's "mistake" on the same pass is
//! precisely the take to comp from. A single band-wide rating would
//! average that away into a three-star nothing.
