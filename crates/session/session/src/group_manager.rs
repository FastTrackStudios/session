//! Track-group manager — realizes the canonical group partition in a project.
//!
//! The DAW exposes a fixed set of track-group slots (REAPER: 128). The
//! **partition** that assigns those slots to fixed instrument-category bands
//! is canonical and lives in [`music_catalog::groups`] (the single source of
//! truth shared across FTS repos). This module owns only the operations that
//! *realize* that partition in a live project.
//!
//! Written against the `daw` domain API (`Tracks` group methods + `Projects`
//! undo) on `daw::reaper::Reaper` — no raw FFI. The REAPER-specific bitmask
//! plumbing lives in the `daw-reaper` backend.
