//! The comp stack: COMP, then EDIT, then TUNE — and the take lanes
//! underneath, never touched.
//!
//! Twenty takes of a kit are twenty items on the kick, twenty on the
//! snare and twenty on each tom, so comping happens on the folder. What
//! it writes is REAPER's own model: a comp **is** a lane, its name is
//! the lane's name, and the chosen stretches are `LINKEDLANE` areas
//! pointing back at the take lanes. Nothing here invents a parallel
//! comping model beside the one the DAW already has.
//!
//! # Why a stack, and why the lower stages are read-only
//!
//! **COMP** is chosen from the take lanes and is the record of *what
//! was chosen*. **EDIT** is derived from COMP and is where every edit
//! lands — the slips, the quantize, the alignment, the hit list.
//! Vocals add **TUNE** above EDIT, because a retune is new audio rather
//! than a retime and wants a stage of its own.
//!
//! The take lanes and COMP are never edited. That is what makes the
//! whole thing non-destructive in a way an engineer can act on: a bad
//! edit is recoverable by deriving a fresh EDIT, and a re-comp does not
//! throw away the edits — it makes a new COMP and a new EDIT from it.
//!
//! # Why a kit comps as a group
//!
//! Choosing a take's region on the folder chooses the same region on
//! every source track of the kit, because a kit cut between its mics is
//! phase-broken and no amount of later editing repairs it. A piece can
//! be taken out of the group deliberately — a fixed snare hit from
//! another take — and that is simply that track's areas differing from
//! its siblings'.
