//! Growing a guitar part: double, add an arrangement, add a layer, add a
//! source.
//!
//! r[impl flow.guitars.dimensions]
//! r[impl flow.guitars.grow]
//! r[impl flow.guitars.mixing.source-defaults]
//! r[impl flow.guitars.acoustics]
//!
//! The four gestures are one operation at four dimensions. A part is
//! organised Arrangement → Layer → Channel → `MultiMic`, and **a level is a
//! folder only when it has more than one member**, so growing at a
//! dimension is always the same two-step move:
//!
//! 1. If that level does not exist yet, insert it — the container's own
//!    content becomes the level's *first* member, which is the only
//!    moment a folder is allowed to appear.
//! 2. Append the next member, named from the template's vocabulary for
//!    that dimension, carrying a copy of the first member's subtree.
//!
//! Nothing is restructured: items stay on the tracks that hold them, the
//! existing tracks keep their guids, and no send is touched.
//!
//! Acoustics need no code of their own. Every name here comes out of
//! `dynamic_template::track_schema`, which answers with the acoustic's
//! vocabulary under an acoustic track and the electric's under an
//! electric one (`flow.guitars.acoustics`).
