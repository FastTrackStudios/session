//! Section / marker vocabulary, shared by the REAPER actions and the
//! browser setlist engine.
//!
//! These three enums used to live in [`crate::keyflow::actions`], which
//! is `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]` because the rest of that
//! module drives REAPER through `daw::service`. But they are plain
//! data, and `setlist::chart_import` + `setlist::service::demo` — both
//! compiled for wasm, both used by the browser player in
//! `task-player-ui` — import them.
//!
//! The result was that `session` did not compile for wasm at all, which
//! failed the `task-web` image build and so the whole deploy. It was
//! invisible locally because a plain `cargo check` builds for the host,
//! and invisible to a `dx build` of the app because that had already
//! been done before the imports landed.
//!
//! So the vocabulary lives here, unconditionally, and
//! `keyflow::actions` re-exports it for the native call sites.

/// A Keyflow hotkey action. The REAPER-side dispatch for these lives in
/// `keyflow::actions`; the type is here so wasm callers can name one.
