//! What `parse_region_section_type` must make of the region names real
//! sessions actually carry.
//!
//! Built from a survey of every distinct marker/region name in the Crescendum
//! (Rockstars) album — 58 of them — rather than from what a tidy naming
//! convention would look like. The canonical vocabulary already handled
//! `pre-chorus`, `Pre- Chorus`, `CH 1`, `Solo {GTR}` and `OUT 2`; it did not
//! handle `pre chorus`, the plain space-separated form and the most common
//! section name in the album after `chorus` itself. Those regions were
//! silently dropped from every setlist built from these projects.
//!
//! The negative cases matter as much as the positive ones: an arrangement
//! note like `back to 4/4` or `double kick part` must NOT become a section.
//! It belongs on the Marks lane, and a parser eager enough to claim it would
//! put a fake section in the middle of the song.
