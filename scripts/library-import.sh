# library-import.sh — a setlist into a Task org's song library.
#
#   scripts/library-import.sh "../sessions/Worship Set.setlist" [--originals]
#
# The library is keyflow's (ADR 0004 in task): each song is a `song:`
# document with its chart attached as the default arrangement, the
# setlist is a `songlist` collection of those songs in order, and the
# song's session — the .RPP, the prepared `.session`, the `.lrc`, the
# Ogg proxies and the waveform peaks — is a File Root named `session/<song-slug>`, checkpointed.
# Originals (the WAVs) go up too with --originals; without, a session
# streams from its proxies.
#
# Uses the `task` CLI, already signed in (`task auth login`). `task song
# add` also wants the org's local directory, so TASK_DATA_ROOT must name a
# data root that holds it (for Task's demo: ~/.local/share/task-demo/acme).
# Safe to run again: a song already in the setlist is not added twice,
# and its session files are re-put (unchanged ones are skipped). Env:
#   TASK      the task binary            (default: ../task/target/debug/task)
#   SESSION   the session binary         (default: target/release-fast/session)
#   KIND      the collection kind        (default: songlist — keyflow's)
#
# Title and artist come from the chart's first line (`Washed - Elevation
# Rhythm`), the key from its `#B`. Proxies missing on disk are made first.
