"""A project with the studio's SHAPE but none of its weight.

Opening Set in Stone costs ~25 s before a frame is drawn: parsing is
quick, but materializing 5.6 GB of takes through the media bay is not.
None of that is what a UI bisect measures — the window's cost is the
tracks, items, folders and markers it has to lay out, and those are
free to fabricate.

So this writes a `.rpp` with the same counts as the real session — 65
tracks with the same folder nesting, 877 items, 16 markers — where every
item's source is an EMPTY MIDI take. There is no media to find, so the
project opens instantly and the layout the studio builds is the same
size it would be for the real thing.

It is not a substitute for the real session as a number of record: real
takes carry peaks, and the arrangement draws waveforms from them. Use it
to HUNT, and confirm on Set in Stone.
