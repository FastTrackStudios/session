`architect` is the entity framework + monorepo template that powers
contract-first Rust projects: one `#[derive(Entity)]` on a plain struct
yields a wasm-clean wire type, an auto-generated vox repository trait,
and (under `--features server`) a SeaORM-backed implementation.

The repo doubles as a working **reference monorepo**: the macro itself
lives in `macros/`, and `examples/app/` (a full-stack demo with
`features/` + Dioxus web/desktop apps) shows the layout and testing
patterns a real project would copy.

## Where to start

- [Getting started](@/getting-started/_index.md) — get the dev shell up,
  run the e2e tests, see the contract round-trip from a browser.
- [Architecture](@/architecture/_index.md) — the patterns the template
  is showcasing: contracts vs. implementations, multi-backend features,
  the facade-with-cargo-features split, the per-feature UI layer.
- [Reference](@/reference/_index.md) — the crate map, derive
  attributes, and what the macro emits.

## Why these patterns

- **Wire formats live in one source struct.** No parallel DTOs, no
  serde-on-one-side-facet-on-the-other.
- **Backends are swappable behind a trait the macro emits.** Same
  code, same wasm tests, different storage.
- **Multi-target by construction.** wasm32, native server, desktop —
  all linked by the same `<feature>-proto` crate.
- **Monorepo template.** `apps/<app>/<role>` + `features/<feature>/`
  scales to many apps and features without crate name collisions.
