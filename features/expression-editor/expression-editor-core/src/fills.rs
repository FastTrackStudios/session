//! Finding the fills in a drum take.
//!
//! A fill is where the drummer stops keeping time and plays something,
//! and it is the one part of a take that must not be quantized like the
//! rest of it. Groove wants to sit on the grid; a fill is often played
//! across the grid on purpose — a triplet run, a drag into the
//! downbeat, a rushed crescendo — and flattening it onto sixteenths
//! takes the performance out. So the editor needs to know where the
//! fills are before it quantizes anything, in order to leave them alone
//! or give them settings of their own.
//!
//! # What separates a fill from the groove
//!
//! Two things, and neither alone is enough.
//!
//! **Toms.** A rock groove is kick, snare and hats; the toms sit unused
//! for whole songs and then carry the fill. Tom activity is therefore
//! the single strongest signal, and it is now available per drum
//! (`kit::detection_units`) rather than as one summed "a tom was hit".
//!
//! **Density.** Not every fill uses toms — a snare roll or a stretch of
//! kick sixteenths is a fill too — so a bar that is simply much busier
//! than the song's habit counts as well.
//!
//! # Against the song's own habit, never a fixed number
//!
//! "More than six tom hits in a bar" is a rule that works on one song.
//! A track with a tom-driven groove would be marked as one continuous
//! fill, and a sparse ballad's one real fill would be missed. So every
//! bar is scored against the **median** bar of that same take.
//!
//! The median, not the mean, and the median absolute deviation, not the
//! standard deviation: fills are precisely the outliers being looked
//! for, and an average is dragged towards whatever it is meant to be
//! detecting. On a song with four fills in sixty bars a mean tom count
//! is pulled up by the very bars that should stand out, and the
//! threshold quietly rises to hide them.
//!
//! Spec: `features/expression-editor/spec/drum-mode.md` (`drums.fills.*`).
