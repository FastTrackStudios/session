//! Folding a recorded kit into the lanes a drum editor reads.
//!
//! Three kick mics and four snare mics are seven tracks, but while
//! editing they are one kick and one snare. This module decides which
//! role a track plays (`Kick` / `Snare` / `Toms` / `Other`), from its
//! place in the host's folder hierarchy first and its name second, and
//! rebuilds the workspace layout as four role lanes, bottom-up:
//! `Kick` at the bottom, `Snare` above it, `Toms` above that, `Other`
//! on top.
//!
//! Nothing here is drum-specific *in type*: a role is a label plus a
//! draw rule, and the fold takes `(guid, role)` pairs. A guitar
//! workspace later defines `DI` / `Amps` the same way.
//!
//! Spec: `features/expression-editor/spec/drum-mode.md` (`drums.lanes.*`).
