//! Prepare real-song copies. Stdout contains only project paths for shell use.
//!
//! `--cached` stages each song ONCE into a reused directory and prints
//! the path again on every later call. Benchmarks want that: a fresh
//! copy is several gigabytes of disk and throws away the `.reapeaks`
//! sidecars the last run built, which is most of a run's startup. Manual
//! practice still wants a fresh copy — that is what the default does.
