//! The expression editor, standalone.
//!
//! One `cargo run --example editor -- <thing>` puts the real editor on
//! screen against a project, a `.mid` file, or a built-in demo scene —
//! no REAPER, no plugin host, no arrangement view, no mixer. The editor
//! is the whole window.
//!
//! ## Why this crate exists
//!
//! Until now the editor ran in exactly one place: a REAPER dockable
//! panel. `spec/reaper-testing.md` records that headless REAPER cannot
//! open a Dioxus panel at all — it aborts inside GDK and takes the daw
//! socket with it — so seeing a change meant a private Xvfb, a window
//! manager, and a REAPER launch. That is the wrong loop for building
//! nine surfaces.
//!
//! ## What is in the library and what is in the examples
//!
//! The library is the *loading*: turn a command line into an
//! [`Editor`], through the same `daw` facade the REAPER module uses, so
//! the standalone path and the in-REAPER path cannot diverge. It has no
//! window in it, which is what keeps it testable — [`Runner::open`]
//! runs headless in an ordinary `cargo test`.
//!
//! The window lives in `examples/editor.rs` and the PNG rasterizer in
//! `examples/shot.rs`, both mounting [`App`]. Blitz and vello are
//! dev-dependencies for exactly that reason: a consumer that wants the
//! loading should not link a GPU stack.
//!
//! ## The window rule
//!
//! Windows go through `dioxus_native::launch_cfg` — Blitz → Vello →
//! winit, dioxus's own desktop path. Not `dioxus::desktop`, which is
//! WebKit/WRY and a completely different rendering engine.
//!
//! And not `nice-plug-dioxus`, which is what this used to open: that
//! opens a *plugin editor* window through baseview, and the expression
//! editor is an application, not a VST3/CLAP plugin. Carrying a plugin
//! framework to open an app window cost a second windowing path, a
//! second renderer to keep in parity, and a `native` feature on the UI
//! crate that existed only to pull it in.
//!
//! `launch_cfg` takes a bare `fn() -> Element`, which is why the loaded
//! document reaches the component through [`stage`]/[`App`] rather than
//! through props.
