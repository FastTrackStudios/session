//! The root component, and the hand-off that gets a document into it.
//!
//! `open_standalone_with_state` takes a bare `fn() -> Element`, and the
//! REAPER panel mounts a component with no props for the same reason:
//! a root that needed props would be a root only one host could build.
//! So the loaded document is *staged* before the window opens and the
//! component takes it on mount.
//!
//! Staging is a take, not a read: the document moves into the
//! component's signal and the slot is left empty. A component that
//! re-mounted would otherwise silently reset the user's edits back to
//! the loaded state.
