//! `expression-editor-paint` — the expression editor as a recorded
//! `anyrender::Scene`, and the pointer and key logic that edits it.
//!
//! No DOM, no renderer, no window, no dioxus. Everything here is a pure
//! map from an [`expression_editor_core::Editor`] to a picture
//! ([`paint`]), or from a pointer event to a change in that editor
//! ([`interaction`]). Whatever anyrender backend a host has replays the
//! scene: Vello on a wgpu surface in the session window, the CPU
//! rasterizer under a WebView, a headless canvas in a test.
//!
//! It was carved out of `expression-editor-ui` so that a host which is
//! not a Dioxus tree — the session window, which drives Vello directly
//! from winit — can draw the roll and the strip at the frame rate the
//! GPU allows, instead of rasterizing every frame to a bitmap and
//! handing it to a web view as an image. The Dioxus crate still owns the
//! chrome around the roll (toolbar, inspector, panels) and re-exports
//! these modules under their old names.
