//! The ruler's height and the mouse agree.
//!
//! The ruler used to be a constant, and half the view took its offset
//! from that constant: the lane translate, the playhead, and the
//! pointer maths that turns a click into a lane. Then the ruler grew a
//! shelf per (ruler lane, kind) of timeline chrome, so a project with
//! regions *and* markers has a taller ruler than one with neither.
//!
//! That is a quiet failure if it goes wrong. Nothing looks broken — the
//! lanes draw correctly, the ruler draws correctly — but the hit-testing
//! is reading from a different coordinate system than the drawing, and
//! clicks land on the lane above or below the one under the cursor. A
//! screenshot cannot catch it. Only a real click can, which is what
//! these do: mount the actual editor, press a real pointer at a real
//! pixel, and ask which track it selected.
