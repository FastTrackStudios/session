//! Labels for the painted roll.
//!
//! The roll draws about fifty short strings: note names on bodies, `C4`
//! down the keyboard, bar numbers along the ruler, marker names. As DOM
//! text those were laid out by Blitz; painted into a scene they have to
//! be shaped here, which means a font and a shaper.
//!
//! ## Why the font is embedded
//!
//! `parley::FontContext::new()` reads the system's fonts, so the same
//! project would draw differently on a different machine and not at all
//! in a browser. The roll's labels are chrome — they must be identical
//! everywhere a shot is compared, and present at all on wasm — so one
//! font ships with the crate.
//!
//! ## Why shaping is cached
//!
//! Shaping is far more expensive than drawing, and these strings repeat:
//! the same twenty pitch names every frame, the same bar numbers while
//! you scroll sideways. Shaped runs are therefore keyed by text and size
//! and reused, so a scroll re-lays nothing out — it only moves glyphs
//! that were shaped once. This is the difference between a scene rebuild
//! costing microseconds and costing milliseconds.
