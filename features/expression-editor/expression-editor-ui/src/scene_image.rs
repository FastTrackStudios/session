//! A painted scene, presented to a renderer that cannot replay one.
//!
//! [`crate::paint`] builds an [`anyrender::Scene`] — a backend-agnostic
//! recording, `Vec<RenderCommand>` of fills, strokes and glyph runs. Blitz
//! replays it directly through a custom widget and that is the fast path.
//! A WebView cannot: it has no seam for handing a native renderer a
//! display list, and panics outright on the attribute that carries one.
//!
//! So the scene is rasterized here and handed over as an image. The
//! drawing code does not change and does not fork — `paint.rs` stays the
//! single description of what these surfaces look like, and this is only
//! how the pixels arrive:
//!
//! | target | seam |
//! |---|---|
//! | dioxus-native | `Widget::paint` replays the scene (GPU) |
//! | dioxus-desktop | this, rasterized natively |
//! | dioxus-web | this, rasterized in wasm |
//!
//! `vello_cpu` is pure Rust with no platform I/O, so the same call works
//! natively and in wasm — which is what lets one seam serve both webview
//! targets.
//!
//! **This is a demo of the approach, not a finished path.** Encoding a
//! PNG and base64ing it into an attribute is the portable way to move
//! pixels into a DOM without any JavaScript, and it is honestly the
//! slowest thing here. What it buys is a measurement: if a pane is
//! comfortable at this cost it needs nothing more, and if it is not, the
//! escalation (a canvas fed raw RGBA, or vello_hybrid's WebGL renderer on
//! web) is a change to this file alone.
