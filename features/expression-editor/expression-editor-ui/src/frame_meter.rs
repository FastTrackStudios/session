//! Where "frames per second" comes from on a WebView.
//!
//! Nothing in this crate paints there — the engine does — so the only
//! honest source is its own presentation loop. `requestAnimationFrame`
//! fires once per composited frame, which is the number that matches what
//! the eye sees; a count of renders or of DOM mutations does not, and the
//! stress guide is emphatic about never labelling one as the other.
//!
//! Averaged in the page and reported a few times a second rather than
//! ticked per frame. A bridge crossing per frame would be a measurable
//! share of the thing being measured, and the interesting quantity over a
//! drag is the sustained rate anyway.
//!
//! Native needs none of this: `RollWidget::paint` is called by the
//! renderer itself, which is a better vantage point than the page.
