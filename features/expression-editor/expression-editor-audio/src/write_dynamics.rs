//! Writing the lanes to the host: one volume envelope, and markers.
//!
//! The sum of the four lanes goes to the take's **volume envelope**,
//! which is the one per-item gain every host already applies — so the
//! result is audible with no plugin in the chain, and stays adjustable
//! in the DAW afterwards.
//!
//! Detected breaths and sibilants also go on as **take markers**,
//! whether or not they are being ducked. A marker is an annotation, not
//! a process: it says "there is a breath here", which is useful to see
//! even when the decision is to leave it alone.
