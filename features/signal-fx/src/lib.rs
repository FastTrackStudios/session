//! signal's rigs as the session engine's built-in FX.
//!
//! signal runs its rigs as small daw projects whose effect slots hold
//! [`PluginInstance`]s — the same trait the session engine hosts. So a
//! rig's pieces can run in a session's own tracks, in-process, with no
//! second engine and no socket:
//!
//! - **`FTS Bass Rig`** ([`bass::BassRig`]): signal's bass chain — a NAM
//!   amp (or preamp) capture, an optional drive capture before it, an
//!   optional cab IR after — on a bass DI.
//! - **`FTS Kit Mic`** ([`kit::KitMic`]): the drum sampler's voices for
//!   one set of a kit's pieces and mics, played from the track's own MIDI
//!   — a piece's close mics on its Sample track, every piece's overhead or
//!   room mics on the kit's sample overhead or room track. The same notes
//!   reach each, so their round robins stay together, as in signal's own
//!   per-track kit.
//!
//! Each keeps what it plays in its state (JSON): which model, which kit
//! preset, which pieces and mics. That is what a session saves, and what
//! prepare writes when it builds the rig.
