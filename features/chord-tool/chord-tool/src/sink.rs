//! The panel knows what you picked; it deliberately does not know how to
//! reach a DAW. That's this seam. `chord-tool` depends only on keyflow
//! and dioxus, so the same component runs in a desktop window with
//! nothing behind it and inside REAPER with a real backend — swapping the
//! sink, not the UI.
//!
//! Provide one with `use_context_provider`; the panel falls back to
//! [`LogSink`] when nothing is provided, which is what makes the
//! standalone example work with no DAW at all.
