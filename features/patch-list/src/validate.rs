//! The list against the room: one role, one entry; every role
//! resolved or marked unresolved.
//!
//! Validation is the one thing that can refuse a list, and it refuses
//! for exactly one reason: two entries name the same role and the
//! profile does not mark it shared — a double-booked channel, caught
//! before a take (spec #48, story 24). A role the room does not have
//! is not a refusal: the plan carries it as [`Resolved::Unresolved`]
//! so a list written elsewhere opens rather than fails (story 23).
