//! The studio profile: `studios/<name>.styx` in the app config
//! directory.
//!
//! A profile is the room's, not the album's (decision #29): the physical
//! inputs a location has and what is patched to them. It owns the role
//! vocabulary — an `inputs` table of role → device channel (or MIDI
//! device and channel), an `outputs` table of bus role → output pair —
//! and the patch list names roles from it, so the same list tracks the
//! same album in two rooms with two profiles and nothing in it changes.
//!
//! An optional patchbay endpoint on a role is what `crates/patchbay`
//! builds and verifies the profile against; resolving a role never
//! needs it.
