//! Applying a plan to a session.
//!
//! Spec #48, decision #29, `flow.patch-list.apply`: every source
//! track's record input, set from its matching entry, as **one undo
//! step**. Arm and input monitoring are untouched — they are live
//! state owned by #55's rig and layer gangs, keyed by the same
//! taxonomy.
//!
//! Matching a [`Selector`] against a session's own tracks by name is
//! the scene engine's job (`dynamic_template::scenes`' own doc: "land
//! with the scene engine (#50)"), and #50 has not landed. Apply does
//! not wait on it: [`Resolve`] is the seam a caller hands in — every
//! track the session has, each with the selector that picks it out —
//! so a hand-built session, an ext-state-backed reader, or eventually
//! the scene engine itself can all drive apply the same way.
//!
//! This module also holds the two things apply leaves behind: the
//! **applied copy** (the styx text just applied, the profile's name,
//! and when — `ext_state::SECTION`/`APPLIED_KEY`) and the **session
//! override** (`OVERRIDE_KEY`, layered by [`crate::layer`]), plus
//! [`stale`], which compares the two.
