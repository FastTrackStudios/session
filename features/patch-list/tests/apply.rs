//! Applying the fixture album to a reference session: every source
//! track's record input, set from its matching entry, through the
//! daw facade, as one undo step. Arm and monitoring are never touched
//! (there is nothing here to touch — apply's whole surface against
//! the backend is `Tracks::set_record_input`, wrapped in one undo
//! block).
//!
//! The reference session is built here, track by track, from the
//! fixture album's own lowered entries — matching a `Selector` against
//! a session by NAME is the scene engine's job (#50, not landed;
//! `dynamic_template::scenes`'s own doc says so), so this test gives
//! each track its own taxonomy directly rather than parsing it back
//! out of a name. One entry (`producer/talkback/mic`) is deliberately
//! left without a track — the fixture's **unused** entry — and one
//! extra track is added that no entry names — the fixture's
//! **unpatched** track.
//!
