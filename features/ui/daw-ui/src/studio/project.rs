//! The project, as one immutable snapshot.
//!
//! Everything the studio draws comes from here, fetched once and then
//! held behind an [`Arc`]. That is the first rule this rebuild is built
//! on: **a component never owns project data it could share**. Dioxus
//! hands a component its props by value on every render, so a
//! `Vec<Item>` prop of a real session's eight hundred takes is a deep
//! copy per render — which is how a UI ends up spending its frame budget
//! memcpy'ing a record it did not change.
//!
//! The snapshot is also *flat and pre-grouped*. Items arrive from the
//! facade as one list for the whole project; a lane wants only its own,
//! and looking that up by scanning is `O(tracks × items)` on every
//! render. Grouping once at fetch time makes drawing a lane an index.
