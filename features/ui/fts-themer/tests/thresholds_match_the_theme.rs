//! The panel and the theme cannot drift apart on collapse heights.
//!
//! This is the seam #148 exists to close. The Dioxus strip reads a Rust
//! constant; REAPER reads `rtconfig.txt`; both encode the same question —
//! at what height does this part of the strip disappear. Nothing else in
//! the two implementations overlaps, and nothing would have noticed a
//! mismatch: the app would collapse at one height and the host at another,
//! and both would look deliberate.
//!
//! So the shipped theme is parsed here and compared against the constant.
