//! Controls as SHAPES, so a third surface can draw them.
//!
//! The crate's premise is that artwork is authored once and consumed
//! twice — live SVG on the web, rasterised PNG for REAPER. Both of those
//! consume *markup*, which was fine while both were SVG consumers.
//!
//! A GPU canvas is not. `anyrender` wants fills and strokes of shapes,
//! and it cannot be handed an `<svg>` string. Drawing the controls a
//! second time for it is exactly the drift this crate exists to prevent:
//! the numbers here were measured off REAPER pixel by pixel — a knob's
//! 11 rim, its 3.5 ring and its 7.5 body — and a canvas that re-invented
//! them would be a second, worse set of the same controls.
//!
//! So the geometry moves one layer down, into data:
//!
//! ```text
//!              paint::volume_knob(value, at) -> Drawing
//!                          │
//!            ┌─────────────┼──────────────┐
//!            ▼             ▼              ▼
//!        to SVG        to anyrender    rasterised
//!      (web, REAPER)   (GPU canvas)     via SVG
//! ```
//!
//! A [`Drawing`] is pure data: no Dioxus, no kurbo, no colour library
//! beyond the theme's own. Coordinates are `f64` — SVG writes them into
//! strings and takes any precision, while a GPU canvas is `f64`
//! throughout, so `f64` is the one choice that makes neither consumer
//! convert on the way in. That is deliberate — the crate is consumed by
//! the PNG rasteriser, which should not grow a GPU stack, and by the
//! canvas, which should not grow a DOM.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! Every drawing is in its own box, origin at the top-left, sized by
//! [`Drawing::w`] / [`Drawing::h`]. Placing it on a row is the caller's
//! transform. Angles are **degrees clockwise from twelve o'clock**,
//! which is the convention the knobs were measured in.
