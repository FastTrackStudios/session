/// Elevation Worship – "Praise" official MultiTracks stem set (23 stems).
/// A / 127 bpm / 4-4 modern-worship session: click + cue guide tracks, an
/// original-mix reference, layered BGVs + choir, organ/keys/piano, electric +
/// synth bass, one acoustic and seven electric guitars, plus a loop and
/// hand/aux percussion.
///
/// This asserts the performance-grouping *contract* the app relies on
/// (membership + which folder each key stem lands in), rather than pinning the
/// exact interior numbering, so it stays robust to cosmetic ordering.
///
/// KNOWN LIMITATIONS (upstream `monarchy`, tracked separately — deliberately
/// NOT asserted here):
///   • The 7 electric guitars sub-nest (6 & 7 in an extra folder) because the
///     global Layers field treats bare digits "1".."5" as layer names but not
///     "6"/"7"; removing them regresses 19 other bands. Needs a monarchy fix.
///   • Choir lands in the top-level Choir group (a sibling of Vocals), not
///     nested under the Vocals bus — a "Choir" subgroup under Vocals duplicates
///     against the top-level group, whose name doubles as a match token. Route
///     Choir to the vocal VCA in the DAW instead.
