//! Organizing a project must only *add* to it.
//!
//! The regression this pins down shipped for months and was invisible until a
//! real album hit it. `--apply-buses` used to read a project into
//! `ReaperProject`, apply the template, and write it back with
//! `to_rpp_string()` — a typed serializer that can only emit the fields the
//! type models. Everything else in the file was dropped: the master track,
//! `<NOTES>`, `<RECORD_CFG>`, all twelve `RENDER_*` settings, `<METRONOME>`,
//! `<PROJBAY>`, `<EXTENSIONS>`, per-item `CHANMODE` and `YPOS`, and every
//! `<EXT>` block carrying the original capture filename. On top of that it
//! wrote each take twice around a `LANE` token REAPER has never had. REAPER
//! opened the result with "11160 elements in the project were not understood".
//!
//! Nothing about that was caught by a test, because every existing test built
//! its project *through* the same typed model — so the fields the model
//! couldn't represent were never there to lose.
//!
//! These tests work the other way round: start from project text containing
//! things the template knows nothing about, organize, and require them back
//! verbatim.
