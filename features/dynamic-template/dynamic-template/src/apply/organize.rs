//! The whole organize pass, once, for every backend.
//!
//! Classify each track, repair the folder structure, colour by
//! classification, build the bus tree the classified tracks justify, route
//! content into it, nest DI captures, and park whatever classified to
//! nothing in `UNSORTED`. The `--apply-buses` CLI runs this over an `.RPP`
//! chunk tree; the Session window and the REAPER action run it over a live
//! project through [`DawTarget`](super::DawTarget). One pipeline, so a live
//! organize and a batch one cannot disagree about a session.
