//! The canonical FTS bus tree — where each instrument group hands off to the
//! mix.
//!
//! [`colors`](crate::colors) answers "what color is this group?" and
//! [`layouts`](crate::layouts) answers "what TCP/MCP layout does it get?".
//! This module answers the third per-group question: **what does it feed?**
//! Like those two it resolves by canonical group path (top-level first, e.g.
//! `["Vocals", "Lead"]`), most specific first, so a sub-group can attach
//! somewhere its parent does not.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Group buses sum into one of two stem buses — `INST BUS` and `VOX BUS` —
//! which sum into `MIX BUS`. That middle tier is what makes an instrumental
//! and an acappella fall out of the session for free: mute one stem bus and
//! the other is already printed.
//!
//! ```text
//! MIX BUS                            (always present)
//! ├─ INST BUS
//! │  ├─ DRUM BUS      ← Drums, Percussion
//! │  ├─ BASS BUS      ← Bass
//! │  ├─ GUITAR BUS    ← Guitars (steel, banjo, mandolin)
//! │  │  ├─ ACOUSTIC BUS ← Guitars/Acoustic
//! │  │  └─ ELECTRIC BUS ← Guitars/Electric
//! │  ├─ KEYS BUS      ← Keys, Synths
//! │  ├─ ORCH BUS      ← Orchestra, Horns, Fiddle, Harmonica
//! │  └─ FX BUS        ← SFX, Tracks
//! └─ VOX BUS
//!    ├─ LEAD VOX BUS  ← Vocals, Vocals/Lead
//!    └─ BGV BUS       ← Vocals/BGVs, Choir
//!
//! CLICK + GUIDE BUS   ← Guide        (parallel to MIX BUS, off master)
//! HEADPHONE MIXES     ← Headphones (per-player cue mixes)
//! TALKBACK BUS        ← Talkback
//! UTILITY BUS         ← Reference (incl. Reference/Stem Split)
//! ```
//!
//! `INST BUS` and `VOX BUS` have no group sources of their own — nothing
//! attaches to them directly, they only sum the group buses beneath them. They
//! materialize when any of those does, via the ancestor walk in
//! [`buses_for_paths`].
//!
//! # Buses are tracks
//!
//! Each bus is a real track, nested as a **folder track** inside the bus it
//! feeds: `DRUM BUS` is a child of `INST BUS`, which is a child of `MIX BUS`.
//! So a bus reaches its parent by the ordinary folder parent-send —
//! [`TemplateBus::parent`] is that nesting, not a send.
//!
//! Instrument folders are the other case: they sit elsewhere in the project
//! and reach their bus by an explicit send
//! ([`NodeRouting::to_bus`](dynamic_template_proto::NodeRouting::to_bus),
//! which drops the parent send). [`bus_nodes`] renders the bus tree as the
//! nested [`TemplateNode`] folder tracks a DAW layer can create directly.
//!
//! The monitor buses sit **beside** `MIX BUS` rather than inside it: click,
//! count-ins, cues, per-player headphone mixes, talkback chatter, the reference
//! master and stem-split imports are all monitor-only, and routing them through
//! `MIX BUS` would print them into any bounce or stem unless muted by hand.
//!
//! Some groups reach **no** bus at all, deliberately: a `VCA` carries no audio,
//! only fader control, so a send from one would be silent. See
//! [`is_deliberately_unrouted`].
//!
//! **No bus exists unless something feeds it.** Every bus is
//! [`WhenPopulated`](BusMaterialization::WhenPopulated), including `MIX BUS`:
//! [`buses_for_paths`] starts from the group paths a session actually contains
//! and keeps only the buses those reach, plus their ancestors. An empty project
//! gets no buses; an acoustic-only session gets `ACOUSTIC BUS` but no
//! `ELECTRIC BUS`, and no `VOX BUS` at all.
