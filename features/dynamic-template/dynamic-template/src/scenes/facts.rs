//! What the engine knows about a track: the input side of the seam.
//!
//! A [`Fact`] is a track as the taxonomy sees it — its kind, its place
//! in the template's group tree, the dimensions parsed out of its name.
//! It is deliberately NOT a `daw_proto::Track`: the engine resolves
//! against sessions read from REAPER, from a project file and from the
//! golden fixture's own tree, and each of those is an adapter that
//! builds facts. The engine never learns which one it is talking to.
