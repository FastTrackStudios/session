//! The selector vocabulary: which tracks a rule is about.
//!
//! A rule starts with a [`Selector`] — which tracks it is about, said in
//! the template's own taxonomy rather than by name. The patch list (#56)
//! lowers to the same vocabulary: an entry is a selector paired with an
//! input role, so the scene engine, the patch applier and the performer
//! rows all agree on what "Cody's amp A 57" means without a second way
//! of saying it.
