//! The scenes themselves, as data.
//!
//! Nine scenes and a common prelude, written as [`Scene`] values rather
//! than as functions. Rust first (spec #48): every type derives `Facet`,
//! so the styx step that follows is a loader and nothing else — this
//! table becomes the built-in layer under a user's and a session's.
//!
//! Every selector says what a track IS rather than what it is called.
//! `Process`, `Compress`, `FX`, `Verb`, `MIX BUS`, `Guide`, `Keyflow`
//! and `Headphones` are taxonomy kinds the template writes when it
//! creates a folder, so renaming `Process` to `Parallel` changes nothing
//! about which scene finds it. A `name` appears only where the track is
//! a return a user picked — `Fat Plate` is a choice of unit, not a
//! structure.
