//! Language: a taxonomy dimension, not a name.
//!
//! `flow.vocals.language`: a vocal source track is sung in one language,
//! or in [`Language::All`] when it is language-free — a wordless "Hey!",
//! a hummed pad. It sits at source level, **under** the performer and
//! the layer, never above them: `Vocals / Ron / Main / {EN, ES, PT}`.
//!
//! Read the same way every other dimension in this crate is read
//! (`track_schema::classify_track_dimension`): from the track's own
//! name first, and when that says nothing, inherited from the nearest
//! enclosing folder that IS a language — `Vocals / Ron / Main / EN /
//! COMP` inherits `EN` from the `EN` folder above it, which is what
//! lets the comp stack (COMP/EDIT/TUNE) live under a language folder
//! without repeating the language on every track inside it.
