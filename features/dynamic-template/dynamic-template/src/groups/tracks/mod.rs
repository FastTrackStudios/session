//! Backing / playback "Tracks" group definitions.

//! Captures pre-produced playback elements that run alongside the live band —
//! loops, sequences, and backing tracks (the "tracks" a worship/live rig plays
//! to). These are distinct from live percussion (they're programmed) and from
//! the reference mix (that's the finished master, not a stem to play).
