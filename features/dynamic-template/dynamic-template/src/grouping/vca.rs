//! Which folders need a REAPER VCA, worked out from the routing.
//!
//! A REAPER folder already sums its children, so its fader scales them
//! for nothing. A VCA is only needed where that is not true: where the
//! children **route past the folder** to a bus, which is what the
//! guitar parts do to `GTR RHYTHM` and `GTR LEAD`. There the folder is
//! a view over tracks whose audio never passes through it, so its
//! fader would move nothing without a VCA lead.
//!
//! This is derived from the routing rather than kept as a list of
//! folder names. A hand-kept list is a second description of the
//! template that drifts from the first one the moment a shape is added.
