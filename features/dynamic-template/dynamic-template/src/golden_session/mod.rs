//! The golden session: the template applying itself to a fixture album.
//!
//! `docs/spec/session/maximal-template.md` describes the reference
//! session every scene is rendered against. This module builds it — in
//! Rust, through `dawfile-reaper`'s builders — from the config-derived
//! template ([`golden_template`](crate::golden::golden_template)) and a
//! fixture song shape ([`shape`]), so the template and its golden cannot
//! drift apart without a test noticing.
//!
//! The fixtures live under `features/dynamic-template/fixtures/golden/`:
//! the two project files are committed, the scene renders beside them
//! are committed, and the media the projects reference is generated.
//! `just daw-template` regenerates all of it; a test fails when the
//! committed text is stale.
