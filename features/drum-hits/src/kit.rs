//! A whole kit at once: every piece's hits, in parallel.
//!
//! This is what a caller runs — on a worker, never a window's thread —
//! with every piece's close mic and trigger read whole at their own
//! rate. It goes in two rounds, because a piece without a working
//! trigger needs to know when the others were struck:
//!
//! 1. Each piece with a trigger, in parallel: the trigger's spikes, the
//!    mic scanned and calibrated against them, the trigger judged
//!    ([`crate::health`]), and — when it is believed — the two fused.
//! 2. Each piece left over (no trigger, a dead one, or told to trust its
//!    mic), in parallel: its mic alone, refusing the bleed of every other
//!    mic, learned at the other pieces' strokes from round one.
//!
//! Spec: `r[hits.detect.calibrate]`, `r[hits.detect.fusion]`,
//! `r[hits.detect.no-trigger]`, `r[hits.detect.trigger-health]`.
