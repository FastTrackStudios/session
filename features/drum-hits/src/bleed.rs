//! A piece with no working trigger, from its close mic alone.
//!
//! With nothing to calibrate against, two things stand in for the
//! trigger:
//!
//! - **The mic's own level split.** Its attacks fall in two clusters —
//!   its own strokes, and everything else's bleed — and the threshold is
//!   the valley between them ([`otsu_db`]), found from the take itself.
//! - **Every other close mic's bleed, predicted.** How loud a snare is on
//!   the tom mic, relative to the snare mic, is a fixed property of where
//!   the mics stand. It is learned at the other piece's *strokes* —
//!   trigger-verified hits where it has a working trigger, else its own
//!   confident moments — where this mic is in its own quiet cluster
//!   ([`bleed_gain`]), and a moment is this piece's only if it is louder
//!   than that prediction by a margin.
//!
//! The strokes matter. Learned from another mic's raw loud moments, the
//! gain from one floor tom to the other came out above unity — both
//! mics were hearing the kick at the same level — and every real stroke
//! on the second was refused as the first one's bleed.
//!
//! Measured on Unbreakable against the triggers it stands in for: about
//! 0.97 F1 on kick and rack toms, but as low as 0.36 on a floor tom,
//! which the kick's low end reaches at full strength. So its hits carry
//! a confidence that says so, and they are the ones to look at.
