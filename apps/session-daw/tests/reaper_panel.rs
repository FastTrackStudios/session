//! The panel, attached to a REAPER it did not start.
//!
//! Everything else in this repo tests the window against a project it
//! owns, or against events handed to `apply_event` by hand. Both are
//! worth having and neither can answer the only question that matters
//! for a control surface: does an edit made HERE reach REAPER, and does
//! a change made THERE come back?
//!
//! So this attaches the way the window attaches — `attach_to_reaper`
//! discovering the host's socket, the global facade installed, the same
//! `Applier` and the same `Watch` — rather than reaching in through the
//! handle the harness already holds. A test that used the harness's
//! handle would prove the services work and say nothing about whether
//! the window can find a DAW it did not start.
//!
//! Run with: `just reaper-test` (see `session-reaper-xtask`).
//!
//! # What the runner says afterwards
//!
//! The scenarios take about four seconds; the run is then killed at the
//! timeout and reported as "Some tests failed", and neither of those is
//! about the tests. The harness's teardown calls `close_project`, and
//! that never returns while this window holds its subscriptions open —
//! daw#31. Read the `test result:` line and the per-scenario timings
//! below it; they are the ones that mean something until that is
//! fixed.
