//! The golden session as the window first shows it — opened on
//! daw-standalone and read back the way the app reads a song
//! (`StudioSession::read_current`), its rows planned by the opening scene
//! (`drum-mixing`), and the strips the arrangement hands the mixer docked
//! under it (`ArrangementWidget::with_mixer`).
//!
//! Not the scene table on its own (`scenes::table`'s tests do that): the
//! same open, read-back, taxonomy, plan and fold the app goes through,
//! because a rule that resolves right in isolation once never reached the
//! mixer — the docked mixer was handed the ARRANGEMENT's rows.
//!
//! One test, one process: the daw facade is bound to the first engine
//! opened.
