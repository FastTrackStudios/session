//! The arrangement, benchmarked headlessly.
//!
//! ```sh
//! just daw-bench                       # the synthetic 65/877 fixture
//! just daw-bench 200 20000             # an orchestral template
//! ```
//!
//! No window, no surface, no vsync. `anyrender`'s `ImageRenderer` draws
//! into a buffer, so this measures what the RENDERER can do rather than
//! what a monitor will accept — which is the number that says whether
//! there is headroom, and the only one that is comparable between
//! machines.
//!
//! The windowed build is pinned to whichever display it opens on: 240 fps
//! on the 240 Hz panel, 180 on the 180 Hz one, both of them simply vsync.
//! Useful for "does it keep up", useless for "how much room is left".
//! This answers the second question, and it runs on a headless box, in
//! CI, or over ssh.
//!
//! It is not a substitute for the windowed number. There is no
//! compositor here and no present, so this is the upper bound on drawing
//! alone. Quote it as that.
