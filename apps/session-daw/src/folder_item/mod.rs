//! Folder items: one item on a folder's row, folded from its children's
//! takes.
//!
//! A kit comped across twenty takes is twenty items on the kick, twenty
//! on the snare and twenty on each tom, and the arrangement becomes
//! unreadable. `flow.drums.comping.folder-items` says the folder shows
//! **one item per take** instead, rendered from the kit's own sources —
//! a view of the takes underneath, owning no audio of its own.
//!
//! Three things make that work, and they are the three modules here:
//!
//! - [`fold`] — many children's peaks onto one column grid, `min(min)` /
//!   `max(max)` per column and per group, with a group-by of role (a
//!   kit's pieces) or side (a Channel's L and R).
//! - [`draw`] — the fold as a picture: the outer envelope dim, the
//!   pieces opaque on top of it in the expression editor's own role
//!   colours; or the two sides as the two halves of one stereo
//!   waveform.
//! - [`cache`] — one recorded scene per `(folder revision, mute mask,
//!   take, zoom bucket, group-by)`, replayed under a transform.
//!
//! The shape came from the prototype on `prototype/folder-items` (issue
//! #27), which rejected translucent fixed-order layers, per-column
//! winners and an amplitude bleed gate on the evidence of its sheets.
