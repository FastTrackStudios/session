//! The setlist: the songs a session holds, and which of them is up.
//!
//! One engine, several projects (`daw_standalone::sync::Standalone` keeps
//! them side by side, as REAPER keeps tabs), and one of them current. This
//! is what the window reads: the songs in order, where the playhead is in
//! the one playing, and the colour each is known by — the setlist tabs in
//! the top bar are that colour, filling as the song plays
//! ([`crate::shell::SongTabs`]).
//!
//! In **Remote** and **Cue** (`crate::audio_mode`) the songs are the
//! projects the driven system has open — REAPER's project tabs, in tab
//! order, the one it has current current ([`Setlist::attach`]). A song's
//! `project` is then the remote's guid, picking a tab selects that project
//! on the remote (`crate::open::switch_song`), and a tab picked in REAPER
//! itself is followed here (`crate::collab_bar::use_follow_song`). The set
//! is what REAPER has open, not a `.setlist` file: to play a set remotely,
//! open its songs as tabs in REAPER.
//!
//! A song's SPAN is the SONG region the chart stamps (`prepare`), which is
//! the part that is the song rather than the count-in before it; without
//! one it is everything the project holds. The span is what a progress
//! reads against, and what tells Live mode a song has ended.
