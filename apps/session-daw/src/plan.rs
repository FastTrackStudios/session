//! Which tracks a scene shows, and how large — as this window sees it.
//!
//! The engine is [`dynamic_template::scenes`]: a table of `Scene` values
//! resolved by one function into a row list. This module is the adapter.
//! It hands that engine the window's track list plus the taxonomy the
//! template wrote into the project, and turns the rows that come back
//! into the `(Track, depth)` pairs the panels record.
//!
//! # Why sizes come back as classes
//!
//! A rule says [`Size::Working`], not 133 pixels. The same scene is
//! applied to two panels and to screens from 1080p to a 5120 ultrawide,
//! so a rule that stated pixels would need a template per monitor.
//! Turning a class into a number is the SURFACE's job, and the table it
//! reads is `scenes::TABLES` — [`mixer_width`] and [`row_height`] are
//! this window's two doors onto it.
