//! A headless Vello renderer that never reads the frame back.
//!
//! # Why not `anyrender`'s `ImageRenderer`
//!
//! Because it measures itself. `VelloImageRenderer::render_to_vec` ends
//! every frame with `copy_texture_to_buffer` — 29 MB of GPU->CPU traffic
//! at 5120x1440, which the windowed app never performs because it
//! presents. That was tolerable while a frame cost 9 ms and the copy was
//! half of it. Once culling brought the drawing itself to about 0.1 ms
//! the copy was fifty times the signal, its own run-to-run drift (4.5 ms
//! to 5.6 ms, measured) swamped everything, and subtracting a median
//! floor started manufacturing p99s that moved several milliseconds
//! between identical runs.
//!
//! You cannot subtract your way out of that. The instrument had to go.
//!
//! # What this measures instead
//!
//! Frames are rendered to a texture and submitted, `BATCH` of them
//! back-to-back, and the GPU is waited on exactly once at the end. No
//! frame is ever copied back. What comes out is THROUGHPUT — how fast
//! this machine can produce arrangement frames — which is the quantity a
//! target frame rate is actually about, and it is measured without a
//! per-frame synchronisation that would serialise a pipeline the real
//! app keeps full.
//!
//! It is still not the windowed number: there is no surface, no
//! compositor and no present here. Quote it as the ceiling on drawing.
