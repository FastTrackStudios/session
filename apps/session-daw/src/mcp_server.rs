//! The running window's Action List, served to a model over MCP.
//!
//! Whatever this window can do is an action in its Action List
//! (`crate::actions`); this puts a model on it while you work — on
//! `http://127.0.0.1:47811/mcp` (`FTS_MCP_PORT` to move it, `FTS_MCP=0`
//! for none). Found without asking: the repository's `.mcp.json` names
//! it for Claude Code, and `~/.config/fts/session-mcp.json` says where it
//! is for any other client.
//!
//! Only this machine reaches it: it listens on loopback and refuses a
//! browser's request from anywhere else (`architect_mcp::http`). A token
//! is optional — `FTS_MCP_TOKEN` sets one, and then a client must send it
//! as `Authorization: Bearer …`; unset, there is none, so a model on this
//! machine connects with nothing to configure.

const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "This is FastTrackStudio Session, the DAW the user mixes in, with the \
song they have open. Its tracks are read with SESSION_TRACKS: each has a GUID and a folder path \
(`Drums/Drum Kit/Kick/Sum/In`); actions that take a track take any of its GUID, its path or a tail \
of the path (`Kick/Sum/Trig`). The kit follows the golden template: each piece (Kick, Snare, \
Tom 1…) has its close mics, its `Trig` (what says the drum was hit — a recorded trigger or the \
kit's notes; it keys the piece's gate and is never heard) and its `Sample` (what plays from the \
trigger), with a `Fund` (or the kick's `Sub`) band-pass beside them. DRUMS_HITS lists a drum's \
hits — run it on the piece's Trig — with times, bars and beats and levels, paged. SESSION_* \
actions are the window's own: what its keys do (SESSION_MODE Edit and SESSION_PHASE edit put the \
window where every cut shows). TRACK_SET changes a track's fader, pan, mute or solo. Drum editing: \
the settings are sticky (DRUMS_EDIT_SETTINGS); tune them with DRUMS_EDIT_SET, which answers at once \
with what they detect, look closer with DRUMS_DETECT over a span, find the fills with DRUMS_FILLS \
(left as played by a slip unless asked), then DRUMS_SLIP — a dry run first. The drum MIDI is a guide, \
not the truth: a live drummer plays other fills.";
