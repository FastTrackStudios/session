//! The arrangement as a recorded scene.
//!
//! Built once, in CONTENT space — seconds along the timeline, row
//! indices down it — and replayed every frame with a transform that
//! carries the scroll and the zoom. `anyrender::Scene` records the
//! commands; `PaintScene::append_scene` replays them into whatever
//! backend is drawing, which on the desktop is Vello on the GPU.
//!
//! That split is the whole design. The scene is rebuilt when the DATA
//! changes — a project opening, a folder collapsing — and never on a
//! scroll, a zoom or a playhead tick. Those are a different `Affine`,
//! not a different scene.
//!
//! # One scene for the panel as well as the lanes
//!
//! Because they must not be able to disagree. The web-view version drew
//! the lanes on a canvas while the track panel stayed in the DOM, and
//! they visibly tore apart while scrolling: native scroll moves DOM
//! content on the compositor, a canvas redraws on the main thread, and
//! nothing reconciles the two. Recorded together and replayed under one
//! transform, being out of sync is not a bug that can happen.
