//! Turning pointer events into things that happened.
//!
//! A window gets presses, moves and releases. A mixer needs clicks,
//! double-clicks and drags — and the difference between them is timing
//! and distance, not anything the window can tell you.
//!
//! # Why a press is not a click
//!
//! The obvious implementation acts on press. It is wrong in three ways
//! that all show up the first time somebody uses it: a press that turns
//! into a drag has already toggled the mute it started on; a
//! double-click has toggled it twice on the way to being a
//! double-click; and a press you drag away from and release elsewhere
//! still counts, when every other application treats that as "I changed
//! my mind".
//!
//! So a click is decided on RELEASE, by what happened in between.
//!
//! # Fine adjustment
//!
//! A fader is a few hundred pixels and its range is sixty decibels, so
//! one pixel is a fifth of a dB — fine enough to mix with and far too
//! coarse to match a level by ear. Holding the fine modifier scales the
//! movement down rather than changing what is being dragged, which is
//! REAPER's behaviour and everyone else's.
