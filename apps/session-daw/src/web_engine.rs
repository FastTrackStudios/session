//! The engine in a browser: daw-standalone in-process, the session opened
//! from text.
//!
//! The native app opens a song from disk, stands up the `daw` facade on a
//! tokio runtime, and reads the session back ([`crate::open`],
//! `StudioSession::open`). A page has no disk and no threads, so it opens
//! the song the same one way from a memory folder
//! ([`crate::open_core::open_song_in`] over [`crate::folder::Memory`],
//! mirrored from a share link by [`crate::song_stream`]) and awaits
//! everything instead of blocking: `build_in_process_daw`,
//! `daw::init_from_parts`, then the same read-back and row plan
//! ([`crate::studio::Planner`]). The engine clients
//! ([`crate::engine::Applier`], [`crate::engine::Transport`]) have web
//! implementations that find the facade this installs.
//!
//! **Reference mode.** A shared song is heard by its reference by default
//! ([`crate::reference`]: its mix but the guide, one stream of a few MB),
//! the guide playing live over it — so joining a set on a phone does not
//! mean downloading every stem. Its takes are attached all the same (their
//! waveforms draw); their bytes are not fetched. A change to the mix needs
//! the stems ([`EngineRef::send`] asks instead, [`Notice::Blocked`]); once
//! they are asked for ([`load_multitracks`]) every song is heard by its
//! stems, each trading its reference for them the moment theirs have
//! arrived at the playhead ([`hear_stems`]).
