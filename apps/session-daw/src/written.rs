//! The drum part as written, held up to the part as played: which note
//! each hit is.
//!
//! A drummer sits ahead of the click or behind it for a whole section —
//! a pre-chorus pushed 40 ms early, a breakdown laid back — and inside
//! that feel a hit can wander a long way: a kick written on 4, played
//! 100 ms early, is nearer the sixteenth before 4 than 4 itself. The
//! nearest line puts it there, a sixteenth early for good, and every bar
//! of the section the same. The written part knows it is on 4.
//!
//! So each piece's hits are matched to that piece's own notes ([`align`]):
//! first the feel — how far the notes sit from the hits nearby that are
//! plainly theirs ([`feel_at`]) — then each hit, moved by the feel, to the
//! nearest note not already taken, one to one, within a sixteenth. A hit with no
//! note near (a variation, a fill the chart does not have) is matched to
//! nothing and placed some other way. A note with no hit is not played.
