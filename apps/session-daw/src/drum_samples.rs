//! Drum samples under the recorded kit: signal's sampled kit, played from
//! the hits the triggers caught.
//!
//! Session's hit markers say where the kit's hits are (`crate::hits`,
//! found once from the triggers and mics); signal plays a sampled kit
//! from notes. This joins them, blended under the recording:
//!
//! - each piece's hits written as notes on its **Sample** track (the
//!   kit's General MIDI note for the piece, the velocity from the hit's
//!   level), and an `FTS Kit Mic` there playing every mic of that piece,
//!   split: its **close** mics on the track's own output, its
//!   **overhead** mics on 3/4 and its **room** mics on 5/6;
//! - the Sample track sending its 3/4 into the recorded overheads and its
//!   5/6 into the rooms, so the sample's ambience is processed and faded
//!   with theirs — sends, not tracks of their own.
//!
//! One instrument plays all of a piece's mics from the same notes, so each
//! hit is the same sample on every one.
