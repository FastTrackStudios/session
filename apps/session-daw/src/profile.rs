//! Per-stage frame timing, shared by the bench and the window.
//!
//! A frame time on its own says a gesture is slow. It never says WHICH
//! part is slow, so every optimization argued from one is a guess — and
//! this session has already paid for three of those (a CSS gradient, a
//! TCP recycling pool, a per-frame scene clone), each of which was
//! reasoned about convincingly and measured at zero.
//!
//! So the rule here is that work gets a stage before it gets an opinion.
//! A frame splits into:
//!
//! - **paint** — our replay loop plus Vello's encoding of what it pushes.
//!   CPU, ours, and the only part we write.
//! - **gpu** — Vello's compute pipeline and rasterisation. Measured by
//!   subtraction, because `anyrender` hands out no device to put
//!   timestamp queries on.
//! - **readback** — the `ImageRenderer` copying the surface back to CPU
//!   memory. A property of the HARNESS: 29 MB a frame at 5120x1440, and
//!   the windowed app never pays it. Measured once against an empty
//!   scene and subtracted, which is the difference between quoting 141
//!   fps and quoting 66.
//!
//! [`Samples`] is the summary used for both stages and whole phases, so
//! a stage table and a phase table cannot drift into reporting
//! percentiles two different ways.
