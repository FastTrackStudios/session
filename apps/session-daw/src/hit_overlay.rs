//! The kit's hit markers, for the arrangement to draw over the drum rows
//! in Edit mode.
//!
//! The markers live on the recordings (take markers, `crate::hits`);
//! what is drawn is where each one plays now, after every edit, read off
//! the window's thread ([`refresh`]) whenever the hits or the edit
//! change and published here. A piece's marks go on that piece's rows
//! only — the kick's on the kick, the snare's on the snare — while an
//! edit moves the whole kit: the marks say where the hits are, the cuts
//! on every row what was done with them. The fill zones are shaded over
//! the kit, being the kit's.
