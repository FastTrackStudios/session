//! The web demo's audio: the session mixed on the page and played through
//! an AudioWorklet.
//!
//! The engine is the one the panels already drive (daw-standalone,
//! in-process, see [`crate::web_engine`]), so a fader or a mute is heard
//! the moment the engine takes it. What a browser adds is three things:
//!
//! - **Stems** stream from their Ogg Vorbis proxies ([`add_stem`]): each
//!   take's source is a `Streamed` one, decoded a few seconds at a time
//!   around the playhead by a feeder this loop runs.
//! - **A reference** ([`reference`]) — the song's mix but the guide, one
//!   stereo stream — plays instead of the stems while the page is in
//!   reference mode: it is mixed in at the playhead over what the engine
//!   renders (the guide, live), and the stems' feeders are held, not run,
//!   so their takes are silent. [`multitracks`] trades it for the stems.
//!   A reference comes in two: its preview (mono, a quarter of the size)
//!   plays wherever the reference proper has not arrived yet.
//!   The stems' meters still move: each is read from its take's waveform
//!   at the playhead ([`PeakMeters`]), through its fader and up its
//!   folders, the way the engine would meter it.
//! - **Output** is an AudioWorklet that plays blocks the page posts it —
//!   a small queue, so the page renders ahead of the device by a quarter of
//!   a second and the playhead the panels see is held back by what is
//!   queued ([`latency_seconds`]).
//! - **Unlocking**: a browser starts audio only inside a gesture, so the
//!   context is made on the page's first press or key ([`unlock`]); until
//!   then the transport runs on the engine's own clock and plays silent.
//!
//! One loop does the work: feed the stems within a time budget, then
//! render until the queue is full. It renders only while the transport
//! advances, and a jump of the playhead (a seek, a stop, a loop) empties
//! the queue so the device follows at once.
//!
//! **In the background.** A hidden page's timers are throttled to about
//! one a second, which starves a quarter-second queue — the song breaks
//! up as soon as the window goes behind another. So the loop is driven by
//! the WORKLET's own reports (the audio thread's, every few milliseconds,
//! and not throttled) as well as by a timer, and the queue is deepened
//! while the page is hidden. The painting stops, as it should: only the
//! audio keeps its cadence.
