//! stored height gets, and how small a row is allowed to become.
//!
//! Both are settings rather than constants, because both are preferences
//! and people disagree about them. A default track height is the first
//! thing anyone changes about a DAW's track panel, and the floor is the
//! whole argument of this module — see [`Layout::min`].
