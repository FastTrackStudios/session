//! A song as one project file: `Song.session`, a Loro doc in a Turso
//! file (`dawfile_store`).
//!
//! The song open in the engine is kept in step with its doc by a bridge
//! (`session::sync::Bridge`) that lives as long as the song is open: it
//! knows which engine FX and item each doc entry is, so a save records
//! only what changed. A save appends that as one update to the song's
//! branch; an open rebuilds the song in the engine from the branch's doc.
//! An alternative or checkpoint is another branch of the same file,
//! forked from the song.
//!
//! Every edit step is history too: once a song is open from (or saved
//! to) its file, each undo step the engine finishes is read into the doc
//! as one commit under the step's name and appended to the file, behind
//! the window ([`record_steps`]). A save is then what folds the file's
//! log back into it.
//!
//! A `Song.session` folder (the format before this) is kept beside the
//! file as `Song.session.legacy` on the first save.
