//! The studio as a panel: the painted arrangement, its ruler, its track
//! panel and its scrollbars, in whatever rectangle it is given.
//!
//! Lifted out of `bin/blitz_shot.rs`, where it was one whole window, so the
//! Session app can dock it beside the other panels (`docs/app-on-blitz.md`).
//! What changed on the way:
//!
//! - **Sized by its container**, not by the window. The window may hold
//!   other panels; this one fills the tile it is put in and reads its own
//!   rectangle back from the layout.
//! - **Input only over itself.** Blitz does not send wheel events to the
//!   DOM, so the wheel, the middle-drag hand and the zoom spring are read
//!   at the winit level — and with other panels in the window, only while
//!   the pointer is inside this panel's rectangle.
//! - **No side rails and no modes.** The modes belong to the app's top bar
//!   now, visible whichever view is up.
//!
//! [`StudioSession`] is what the panel stands on: the opened, prepared
//! session and the reads the widget is built from. The app opens it once
//! and provides it as context; every Arrangement panel reads that.
