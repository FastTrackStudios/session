//! What is under the pointer.
//!
//! One function per surface, each answering the same question: given a
//! point in the window, what did you just touch, and in what
//! [`MouseModifierContext`]?
//!
//! # Why the context comes back with the target
//!
//! REAPER's mouse behaviour is not "this widget handles clicks". It is a
//! table: for each CONTEXT — a media item's left edge, a fade, an
//! envelope segment, the ruler — and each modifier combination, an
//! action. That is what makes it configurable, and it is why the answer
//! here is a context and not a callback.
//!
//! So a hit is two things: a [`Target`] the app can act on directly
//! (this strip, this row, this rail button), and a context to look up
//! when the action should be configurable. Simple controls — a mute
//! button, a rail button — carry [`MouseModifierContext::Custom`] and
//! nobody is expected to rebind them. The ones REAPER makes
//! configurable, because the same click means different things in
//! different places, carry the real contexts.
//!
//! # Why this is not on the recorded scene
//!
//! The panels are recorded once and replayed under a transform, so
//! there is no retained tree of widgets to ask. Hit testing is
//! therefore arithmetic over the same layout the recording used —
//! `Columns`, `Frame`, the row offsets — which has the useful property
//! that a hit and a draw cannot disagree unless the arithmetic does.
