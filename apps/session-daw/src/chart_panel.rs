//! The Chart panel: the song's keyflow chart, engraved and painted with a
//! live playback cursor, pannable and zoomable — the native counterpart to
//! the web chart panes.
//!
//! Session's own `apps/desktop/src/session_chart_pane.rs` and, further
//! along the same design, `task`'s
//! `crates/player-ui/src/session_chart_pane.rs` (paginated A4 pages,
//! drag-to-pan, wheel-to-zoom, auto-follow to the playhead's page) render
//! fontless SVG through a browser engine — no wgpu, no canvas — because
//! that is what a wasm build can do. Blitz is not a browser, so this
//! paints straight into the widget's own scene instead, through
//! `keyflow::engraver::renderer::ChartView`: the SAME layout engine, the
//! same [`keyflow::engraver::layout::chart::cursor::ChartCursor`] playhead
//! math, and the same embedded fonts those SVG panes call — only the last
//! step, painting, differs from theirs. `ChartView` also paints the page
//! white, behind the notation, the way sheet music reads.
//!
//! **Interaction** matches the keyflow site (a browser: a trackpad's
//! two-finger scroll pans a page, an actual mouse wheel or ctrl+scroll
//! zooms it — Safari's and Chrome's own split): a trackpad scroll (winit
//! delivers it as `PixelDelta`, smooth and on both axes at once) pans;
//! ctrl+scroll, or a plain wheel on an actual mouse (`LineDelta`, discrete
//! single-axis steps — winit's own way of telling the two apart on
//! macOS), zooms. A middle-drag pans too, for a mouse that has one.
//!
//! **The count-in offset.** The DAW's transport and the chart's own layout
//! do not share a zero: the chart's timeline starts at its first REAL
//! measure (the count-in is a header snippet at negative chart time), while
//! the transport's seconds run from the project's own start, before any
//! count-in. This panel reads the SONGSTART marker once at construction and
//! subtracts it from every transport read, so a playhead over the count-in
//! lands on the count-in header rather than nowhere — the same subtraction
//! task's pane docs as its own playhead model.
//!
//! **v1**, scoped down from task's pane: one continuous column rather than
//! paginated A4 pages, and no auto-follow yet (manual pan takes priority —
//! the two would fight without a "the user just touched it" timeout, which
//! is the thing to add before bringing auto-follow back). Bringing
//! pagination here is the next step; port `DocRender`'s page-box math from
//! task's pane rather than rewriting it.
