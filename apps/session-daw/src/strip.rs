//! Where everything on a strip is — computed once.
//!
//! Every layout bug in this panel has been the same shape: a value that
//! has to match, worked out twice from different inputs. The button line
//! recomputed per strip instead of read. The strip's height taken from
//! the mixer instead of the strip. The bands resolved once for the
//! recorded chrome and again for the live controls, against different
//! heights.
//!
//! A layout engine removes that class by construction — you declare
//! once and it solves once — and the measurement said the DOM costs
//! four times the frame budget at these strip counts. So the panels
//! stay recorded, and this is the property taken from the idea without
//! the renderer: **one function computes the geometry, and drawing,
//! hit-testing and the live overlay all READ it.**
//!
//! The rule that follows is worth stating because it is what was being
//! broken: a control's position is not recalculated at the point of
//! use. If two places need it, they read the same [`Strip`].
