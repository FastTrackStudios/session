//! What the pointer is on, and what it is doing to it.
//!
//! The panels are recorded scenes replayed under a transform, so a
//! control cannot change appearance without the whole panel being
//! re-recorded — which is the one thing the architecture exists to
//! avoid. Hover is therefore an OVERLAY: the recorded strip draws the
//! control at rest, and the one control under the pointer is drawn
//! again on top, in its hover or pressed cell.
//!
//! That costs one control per frame instead of a mixer per mouse move,
//! and it is the same pass the meters and the play cursor need — all
//! three are "something live over something recorded".
//!
//! The art already has the states: REAPER's theme sheets carry three
//! cells per control and `Interaction` names them, so hovering is
//! choosing a cell rather than inventing a highlight.
