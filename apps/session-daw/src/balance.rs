//! Volume balance groups: faders that move against each other.
//!
//! A drum bus with parallel compressors under it — Dry, Tight, Punch,
//! Smash, Crunch — is a blend, and a blend is a balance game: every
//! time one comes up the others should come down by the same amount
//! between them, or the loudest colour wins by being loudest rather
//! than by being right. So the members of a group are linked: moving
//! one fader by Δ dB moves each of the others by −Δ/(n − 1), where n
//! is how many are IN.
//!
//! A fader pulled all the way down is OUT — you have decided you do
//! not want that colour — so it stops taking its share of the
//! compensation, and the others split it between fewer of them. It
//! stays out until you bring it back up yourself; while it is out it
//! is not moved, and its first move back up does not move the others
//! (there is no Δ from silence).
//!
//! The rule is the old FTS Volume Balancer's, stated in decibels
//! rather than as a constant linear sum: a mixer moves faders in dB
//! and reads them in dB, and a quarter of a decibel is a quarter of a
//! decibel wherever the fader is.
