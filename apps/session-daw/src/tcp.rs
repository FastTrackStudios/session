//! The track control panel, drawn into the recorded scene.
//!
//! # Why this is not the DOM row
//!
//! `daw_ui::components::tcp::TrackRow` is the REAPER-matched panel, and
//! it stays the reference: every coordinate here comes from
//! `daw_theme_art::geometry::tcp`, the same measured constants that row
//! positions its controls with. Neither file is allowed to invent a
//! number. When REAPER's layout is re-measured, both move, because both
//! read the same constants.
//!
//! What differs is the RENDERING, and only because it has to. The DOM
//! row is a tree of elements with SVG controls inside it; this is a list
//! of fills and glyph runs recorded once and replayed under a transform.
//! The panel had to come onto the canvas because it could not otherwise
//! stay level with the lanes — native scroll moves DOM content on the
//! compositor while a canvas redraws on the main thread, and the two
//! visibly tore apart while scrolling.
//!
//! # What is drawn, and what is not yet
//!
//! Drawn: the tint, the left column and its rule, the track number, the
//! name field with the record arm on it, the name, volume and pan, the
//! routing and FX buttons, the envelope button, the FX slot, the record
//! input combo, mute and solo in their gutter, phase, and the meter.
//!
//! Not yet: the meter's live level (it draws its well, because at rest
//! REAPER's shows nothing), the fixed-lanes button, and hit testing.
//! Those are the next pieces, and they are listed here rather than left
//! to be discovered as absences.
