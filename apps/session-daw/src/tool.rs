//! Tools and the mouse pointer.
//!
//! Two things decide what a press over the arrangement does, and the
//! pointer's shape has to say which one is in charge:
//!
//! - a **tool**: a mode the panel holds (the zoom spring on a held `z`,
//!   the hand on a held middle button). While one is up it owns the
//!   mouse outright. The arrangement's own gestures stand down, or a
//!   zoom-drag would also drag out a time selection underneath it.
//! - otherwise, the **mouse map** ([`crate::mousemap`]): the context
//!   under the pointer and the keys held pick an action, and the pointer
//!   shows what a drag from here would do (a trim arrow on an item's
//!   edge, a crosshair once Ctrl turns the drag into a razor, the copy
//!   badge on Alt), so a modifier's meaning is visible before it is used.
//!
//! [`Pointing`] is shared between the panel (which knows about tools and
//! the keyboard) and the widget (which knows what is under the pointer).
//! The shape is set on the window directly, not through CSS: Blitz reads
//! a node's `cursor` only when the pointer crosses into another node, and
//! the whole arrangement is one node.
