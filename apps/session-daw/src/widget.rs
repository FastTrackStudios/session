//! The arrangement as ONE node: ruler, track panel and lanes, painted
//! rather than built.
//!
//! # Why this one surface is not a DOM
//!
//! Everything else in the window is better as components — a button
//! wants `:hover`, focus, a name a screen reader can say, and a layout
//! somebody can change without recompiling. The arrangement wants none
//! of that and pays dearly for all of it.
//!
//! Measured on the golden session at 5120x1440, the same picture drawn
//! both ways and gated pixel-for-pixel against each other (by a test
//! that went with the component lanes once they lost):
//!
//! | gesture | painted | as a component tree |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | scroll | 1.06 ms | 15.5 ms |
//! | zoom | 0.71 ms | 21.8 ms |
//! | the whole session on screen | 3.77 ms | — |
//!
//! Fifteen to thirty times, and it is not the GPU: that is 0.3–1.0 ms
//! either way. It is ten thousand nodes going through Stylo's cascade,
//! Taffy's layout, damage propagation and a per-node paint walk, every
//! frame, to produce a picture that a recorded command list replays in
//! one. No amount of tuning closes a gap of that shape — a month of it
//! took the component tree from 124 ms to 15, and 15 is still not 4.17.
//!
//! So the arrangement becomes a [`Widget`]: one element in the DOM, laid
//! out and positioned by CSS like any other, whose contents are drawn by
//! the renderer this window already had. The toolbars, the transport and
//! the rails stay components, because for them the DOM is the point.
//!
//! # What this costs, honestly
//!
//! Hit testing, keyboard focus and accessibility inside this rectangle
//! are ours to write. The first two we already wrote — the wheel is
//! handled at the winit level because Blitz dispatches no wheel event,
//! and `arrange_edit` has done item hit testing from the start. The
//! third is the real debt: a screen reader sees one element here. The
//! answer is that every piece of session state is reachable through the
//! CLI and the RPC surface, so the window is not the only way in — but
//! that is an argument, not an implementation, and it should be written
//! down as one.
//!
//! # Why it still runs in a browser
//!
//! [`Widget::paint`] returns an `anyrender::Scene` — a list of
//! commands, not a wgpu call. Whatever can replay that list can draw
//! this: the CPU backend, the WebGL-class one, and a canvas in a browser
//! tab. The escape hatch that takes a `Device` and `Queue` in
//! `can_create_surfaces` is the one that would tie us to native, and
//! this does not use it.
