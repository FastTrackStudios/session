//! `daw_theme_art` drawings, painted into the recorded scene.

//! This is the second consumer of [`daw_theme_art::paint`]: the first is
//! the SVG the DOM and the PNG rasteriser use. Both read the same shape
//! data, so the knob on the canvas and the knob in the browser are the
//! same knob — which is the entire reason the shape layer exists rather
//! than the canvas drawing its own.
//!
//! Nothing here decides what a control looks like. If a knob is wrong,
//! it is wrong in `paint`, and fixing it there fixes both surfaces.
