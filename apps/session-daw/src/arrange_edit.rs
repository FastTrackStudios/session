//! Editing in the arrangement, as a state machine the window drives.
//!
//! The window gets winit events; this gets what they meant — a hit,
//! a time under the pointer, the keys held, a bound action — and
//! answers with what changed here and what has to happen elsewhere
//! ([`Effect`]: an edit for the engine, a re-record, a transport
//! move). Nothing in here knows a window, which is what makes a
//! gesture testable: a test builds a project, records it, presses on
//! an item, moves, releases, and reads the effects — the same code the
//! window runs, without a display.
//!
//! The window's copy of the project is edited here too (`&mut
//! Project`), so a prediction and the edit it predicts are one place.
