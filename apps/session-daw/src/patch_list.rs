//! The Patch List view: source kinds against inputs, grouped by
//! performer.
//!
//! Read-only here (spec #48, `flow.patch-list.plan`): the table is a
//! projection of the album's list resolved against the active studio
//! profile, drawn the way tracking sorts — each performer a header,
//! their rig under it, one row per channel or mic — with the headphone
//! buses at the bottom and every role the room does not have marked
//! rather than dropped. Editing a row, applying the plan and the
//! per-session override are #57.
//!
//! The picture is recorded the way every other view in this window is:
//! one `PaintScene`, explicit geometry, the embedded font, no CSS and
//! no layout engine — so the bench can draw it headlessly and the
//! committed PNG is the fixture.
