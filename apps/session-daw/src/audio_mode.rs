//! Where this window's sound comes from — the audio mode — as a STATE, not
//! only a launch choice (issue #142).
//!
//! Three modes, ordered by how much of the audio is made here:
//!
//! - **Remote** — nothing. This window drives another system (REAPER
//!   today, another Session engine soon) through the `daw` facade, and that
//!   system owns the project and plays it.
//! - **Cue** — Remote, plus a small local engine that plays the click and
//!   the guide, sample-locked to the remote (`crate::cue`; it reports
//!   through [`set_cue_ready`]).
//! - **Engine** — everything: the in-process daw-standalone engine owns the
//!   project and plays it through this machine's device.
//!
//! What was ASKED for (`requested`) and what is POSSIBLE right now
//! (`effective`) are kept apart, because an Engine whose media is still
//! arriving — streamed from Task or from a peer — cannot play yet but can
//! already show everything that is data: the session doc, the arrangement,
//! the peaks, the chart, the transport following the session. So it starts
//! as Remote and climbs:
//!
//! ```text
//!   Remote ──(click/guide assets ready)──▶ Cue ──(every proxy loaded)──▶ Engine
//! ```
//!
//! The loader drives the climb with [`begin_asset_load`],
//! [`set_cue_ready`] and [`set_assets_progress`]; the effective mode is
//! never more than the requested one ([`ModeState::effective`]). An Engine
//! opened the ordinary way loads its media before the window and never
//! calls any of them, so it is Engine from the first frame — as before.
//!
//! Which BACKEND the facade points at follows the request, not the
//! effective mode: a streamed Engine is the local engine filling up, not a
//! remote one ([`ModeState::owns_project`]). That is what every call site
//! that used to reach the local engine directly now asks
//! (`crate::open::with_local_engine`).
//!
//! Platform-neutral (the web page's top bar reads it too); the native
//! launch that SETS it lives in `crate::open`.
