//! Session's Action List: everything the window can do, in the one
//! registry its keys, its menus and a model talking MCP all run.
//!
//! [`list`] is the list (`architect::action::ActionList`), filled on first
//! use. Two kinds of action are in it:
//!
//! - **The window's** — transport, selection, the edit cursor, zooms,
//!   panels, comping, gain staging: what a key does. Running one queues
//!   it ([`take_window`]); the window applies the queue on its next pass,
//!   through the same code a key press always went through. A key press
//!   itself runs here first ([`through_list`]), so a key and a model are
//!   one path.
//! - **The session's data** — its tracks, a drum's hits, a drum's
//!   fundamental, a track's fader: run against the engine directly, typed
//!   in and out, so a model can read the song and change it.
//!
//! Every engine edit the window applies is reported as a change
//! (`crate::engine`), so a model's `watch` follows what happens in the
//! app as it happens.
