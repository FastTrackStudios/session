//! Each song's own mode: the one it was last worked in, taken up again
//! whenever it is gone to — Live until it is put in another.
//!
//! A song still being recorded is a Record song; a live-tracks song is a
//! Live one; a song being mixed is a Mix one. Picking it — from its tab,
//! the set menu, the start of the set — puts the window in its mode, and
//! changing the mode while on it is what it is remembered as. Kept by the
//! song's name (a streamed song's engine id is new each time it opens),
//! on this device: a file in the app's data folder, a page's local
//! storage.
