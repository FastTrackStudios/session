//! The mixer's controls are drawn live so that a mute can change
//! without the mixer being re-recorded. Whether that is actually cheap
//! is a claim, and a claim about a renderer is worth exactly as much as
//! the frame that proves it.
//!
//! So this drives every parameter on every track — mutes and solos
//! toggling, arms flipping, faders sweeping, pans crossing — at rates
//! chosen to be worse than a person can produce. If the live pass holds
//! its frame rate against that, it holds against anything a user does.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT random. A stress test that cannot be replayed is a
//! stress test that cannot be bisected: the same `t` gives the same
//! session state on every run and every machine, so two measurements
//! are of the same work.
