//! What the window says when it will not do a thing.
//!
//! An edit that cannot honestly be made carries a sentence saying why —
//! [`crate::arrange_edit::Effect::Refused`]. Until this existed the
//! sentence went to the log, which is to say nowhere: on the golden
//! session every row is a folded folder, so every item drag was refused
//! and the window looked like one whose item editing did not work. The
//! logic was right and invisible, which from the hand's point of view
//! is the same as being wrong.
//!
//! It is drawn ON the row it is about rather than in a corner. A
//! refusal is always about a particular row — "the takes under THIS row
//! do not line up" — and a corner toast makes the reader carry the
//! message back to the row themselves, which on a session tall enough
//! to need scrolling is a hunt.
//!
//! And it goes away. A refusal is a reply to a gesture, not a state the
//! session is in; something that stayed would have to be dismissed, and
//! a dismissal is another thing to do with a mouse that is already
//! mid-edit.
