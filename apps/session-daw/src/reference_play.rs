//! A streamed song heard by its reference on this device — what a phone
//! joining a shared set plays by default, as the web page does
//! ([`crate::web_engine`]): one stereo stream of a few megabytes (the
//! song's mix but the guide, [`crate::reference`]) instead of every stem,
//! the guide playing live over it from the engine.
//!
//! The stems are attached all the same (their waveforms draw) but their
//! bytes are not fetched ([`crate::stream_set::stream`]). Loading the
//! multitracks ([`load_multitracks`]) fetches them; each song keeps its
//! reference until its stems have arrived at the playhead
//! ([`crate::stream_set`] hands over), so there is no gap.
//!
//! The reference is mixed into the device's output by the audio engine's
//! post-render hook ([`renderer`], installed by `crate::open`), for the
//! song the engine is playing.
