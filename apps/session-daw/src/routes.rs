//! What a track sends to, and what it receives from.
//!
//! The strip has always known WHETHER a track has sends — `send_count`
//! rides on the track and lights a lane in the corner. That is all a
//! mixer needs to draw itself, and it is deliberately all the track
//! stream carries: a bulk read of two hundred tracks must not also be a
//! bulk read of their routing.
//!
//! This is the other half, read only for the tracks something is
//! actually looking at. A route is a destination, a level, a pan, a
//! mute and a mode, and every one of those is a thing you change while
//! listening — so they arrive the way notes do: the window draws what
//! it has, asks for the rest, and redraws as the answers land.
//!
//! # Why a cache and not a fetch per frame
//!
//! Reading one track's sends is a round trip, and the panel is open
//! while you drag a send's level. Asking per frame would put the
//! network in the middle of a gesture. So the window holds the routes,
//! predicts its own edits into them, and lets the routing bus correct
//! it — the same shape the track list already uses, for the same
//! reason.
