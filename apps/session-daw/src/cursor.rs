//! The play cursor, the edit cursor, and the time selection.
//!
//! Three different things that all look like a vertical line, and
//! confusing them is the classic DAW bug:
//!
//! - the **play cursor** is where the audio is. It moves on its own and
//!   you cannot put it anywhere; you can only ask the transport to.
//! - the **edit cursor** is where YOU are. It moves when you click and
//!   stays where you left it.
//! - the **time selection** is a span, and it is what most commands act
//!   on when it exists.
//!
//! # Why the play cursor extrapolates
//!
//! The engine reports its position once per audio block — every few
//! milliseconds, and not on a schedule the display shares. Drawn
//! straight from that number, the cursor advances in steps of a block
//! however fast the window presents, which reads as stutter on a 144 Hz
//! display and is the whole reason REAPER users install
//! `ReaSmoothPlayhead` to replace the native one.
//!
//! So the position is a line, not a point: the last report, plus the
//! time since it arrived multiplied by the rate. Between blocks the
//! cursor glides; when the next block lands it corrects. The correction
//! is sub-pixel as long as the extrapolation is honest about the rate,
//! which is why [`Playhead::seek`] exists — a jump is told to the
//! cursor rather than inferred from a position that moved too far.
