//! What a gesture means where it lands.
//!
//! REAPER's mouse behaviour is a table: for each CONTEXT — a media
//! item, its left edge, a fade, the ruler, the empty arrange area —
//! and each modifier combination, an action. [`crate::hit`] answers
//! "what did you touch, and in which context"; this answers "and what
//! does that do", so the two stay separately configurable: a hit test
//! is geometry, a mouse map is preference.
//!
//! The table here is the FTS default. A mouse profile
//! (`input_config_proto::MouseProfileConfig`) is the same shape — a
//! context, a modifier set, a behaviour — and is where a user's
//! overrides will load into once the profile system reaches this
//! window; the contexts are already its contexts.
