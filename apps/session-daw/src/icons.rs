//! The toolbar icons REAPER already has, in the rails.
//!
//! `MixPhase::icon` names a file, and `fts-icons` renders and installs
//! it: one PNG holding three cells side by side — normal, hover,
//! clicked — which is the same `Interaction` the rest of this window
//! draws with. So an icon is not new art; it is art this project
//! already ships, read from where it was installed.
//!
//! # Why the words survive
//!
//! Every icon is optional at every step: the resource path may not
//! exist, the file may not have been installed, the PNG may not decode.
//! A rail that failed to find an icon prints its label, which is what
//! it did before this module and is legible either way. An icon is an
//! improvement on a label, never a requirement for one.
//!
//! # Why they are cached as three images
//!
//! The strip is one image and the cell is a third of it. Cropping with
//! a brush transform would need `Extend::Pad` and would smear the
//! neighbouring cell along the edge at any non-integer scale; slicing
//! at decode time costs three allocations once and cannot smear.
