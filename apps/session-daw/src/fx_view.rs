//! The FX view: the selected track's effects as a row of devices.
//!
//! The mixer's racks show a track's processing stacked over its strip, at
//! a strip's width; this lays the same processors out the way Ableton and
//! Bitwig do — side by side, each a device at an editor's size, the row
//! scrolling sideways. Docked under the arrangement or the mixer, or a
//! view of its own (`shell::FxToggle`). See `docs/fx-view.md`.
//!
//! The devices are the rack's own panels, drawn by the rack's painters
//! and edited through its grips — the settings every rack view shares
//! (`tone::Shared`), so an edit here is an edit on the strip.
//!
//! A lane reads left to right: the track's own mixer strip, its chain
//! grouped by phase (a folded phase is its macro knobs — `macros`), and
//! then, after a gap, the returns it feeds — the reverbs and delays in
//! its folder — each as its strip and its effect. Several lanes are the
//! selected track and the tracks beside it in its folder: Kick, Snare,
//! Toms, Cymbals.
