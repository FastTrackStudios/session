//! The Tone rack — EQ, compressor and saturation, inside the strip.
//!
//! The mix phase after Balance is Tone, and it is three processors:
//! compression, EQ, saturation. The parallel filters and the parallel
//! compressors are a different phase and are deliberately not here.
//!
//! A channel strip that shows those three is a channel you can mix
//! without opening a plugin window, which is the whole point — a mix is
//! a comparison between tracks, and a comparison you have to make one
//! floating window at a time is not a comparison.
//!
//! # It draws the plugins' own curves
//!
//! Every response in this module comes from the function the plugin's
//! own editor draws with:
//!
//! | panel | curve from |
//! |---|---|
//! | EQ | `eq_ui::eq_graph_response::calculate_combined_response` |
//! | Compressor | `comp_ui::comp_graph_svg::compress_transfer` |
//! | Saturation | `saturate_dsp::preamp::analysis::transfer_curve` |
//!
//! None of the maths is here, and that is the point: a curve in the
//! strip that disagreed with the curve in the plugin window would be
//! worse than no curve at all, because it would be believed. This module
//! samples those functions into polylines and places them in a box.
//!
//! # What it does not do yet
//!
//! Move. The curves depend only on the parameters, so they are recorded
//! into the mixer's scene once and replayed under the transform like
//! everything else. The parts that DO move — gain reduction, the
//! spectrum behind the EQ — are metering, and metering arrives through
//! `daw_ui::widgets::trace` in a live pass over the top, so that a track
//! whose processing was rendered offline still animates.
