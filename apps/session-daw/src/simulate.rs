//! session has no media, a session being laid out has nothing playing,
//! and a machine with no audio device has nothing at all — so the
//! panels that exist to show a signal are the panels you cannot look
//! at while you build them.
//!
//! This is a signal. Not a recording and not noise: a deterministic
//! function of `(track, seconds)` that behaves enough like a drum kit
//! to exercise every path a real one would. Deterministic because a

//! same second gives the same frame on every machine, which is what
//! lets a screenshot be a test.
//!
//! # It is not a fake meter
//!
//! It feeds the SAME inputs the engine feeds: a `TrackLevels` for the
//! meters and a dB-per-bin spectrum for the EQ. Nothing downstream
//! knows the difference, which is the only way a simulation is worth
