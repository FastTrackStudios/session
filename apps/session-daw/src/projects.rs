//! The songs worked on lately, and each song's alternatives.
//!
//! **Recent** is a list of songs (and setlists) in the order they were
//! last opened, kept beside the app's other memories
//! (`~/.local/share/Session/recent.tsv`): a line each, newest first —
//! when, the song, and which of its versions was open.
//!
//! **Alternatives** are a song's named checkpoints, as Logic keeps them: the
//! song as it stood when the checkpoint was made ("Organized", before the
//! mix), a branch of its project file (`Unbreakable.session/Organized`).
//! Making one does not open it: the song stays what is open, under its own
//! name. Any alternative opens as itself later, and saving it then writes
//! it.
//!
//! A song is known by its **base** — its folder and name without an
//! extension (`…/unbreakable/Unbreakable`) — so its `.RPP`, its `.session`
//! and its alternatives are one song.
