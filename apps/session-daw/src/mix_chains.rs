//! The mix's processing, from the FTS processors built in: what a
//! prepared song is mixed with in this window, no plugin loaded.
//!
//! - Every recorded track gets a **Tone** chain — FTS EQ, Comp, Saturate,
//!   the three the strip's Tone rack draws — bypassed: a channel ready to
//!   mix, costing nothing until it is switched on.
//! - Every bus gets FTS EQ and Comp, bypassed.
//! - The drum Process folder's parallel compressors get FTS Comp set
//!   from gentle to crushed, its rooms FTS Reverb set from a small room
//!   to an arena: on, since a muted track's chain is not run
//!   (`daw_standalone` render), and they are muted until picked.
//! - A drum piece keyed from its trigger (`key_drum_gates`, a send onto
//!   its channels 3/4) gets FTS Gate, on and keyed from that sidechain,
//!   ahead of its Tone chain: the threshold read off the trigger's own
//!   hits ([`gate_threshold`]).
//! - The golden template's returns — the kit's Verb banks, the vocals'
//!   Vox FX delays, verbs, widener and octaves — their FX set, on
//!   ([`return_fx`]); its one-note `Fund` and `Sub` tracks a gate, a
//!   band-pass and saturation, bypassed.
//! - The instrument folders and the folders directly in them get the
//!   bus chain, bypassed, as the golden mix's do.
//!
//! A track that already has FX keeps them and gets nothing added.
