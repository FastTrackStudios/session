//! Three things cannot be recorded with the strips: the control under

//! with the audio), and the play cursor (it changes with the clock).
//! All three are the same shape of problem — something live over
//! something recorded — so they are one pass.
//!
//! Drawing them here costs a handful of shapes a frame. Re-recording
//! the mixer to show a hover would cost the whole mixer, which is the
//! thing the recorded-scene architecture exists to avoid: a hover is
//! the most frequent event a window gets.
