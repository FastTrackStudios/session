//! The app's frame, shared by the window and the page: the main views, the
//! setlist's own tabs, the transport and the mode, and the Overview's
//! layout.
//!
//! Both hosts draw the same bar over their own panels — the desktop app
//! adds the window's drag surface and the traffic lights' corner, the page
//! adds neither, and everything else here is the same in both. What a host
//! passes in is only what is host-shaped: its transport bar, and the panels
//! a view is made of.
//!
//! Four views, in the order a service goes through them:
//!
//! - **Setup** — the setlist, and the routing. What is done before.
//! - **Performance** — the chart and the progress, for playing from.
//! - **DAW** — the arrangement and the mixer, for working on.
//! - **Overview** — all of it at once: progress across the top, the chart
//!   down the left, the arrangement with the mixer docked under it on the
//!   right. The first of the docked views.
