//!
//! A region says how its stretch is edited: on a grid of its own (`Grid`:
//! 78.3 to 79 is half-note triplets, those are the hits), left as played
//! (`NoQuantize`), a fill (`Fill`), or just a note. A marker is a named
//! moment. They are set ahead of the edit — by hand, or proposed from the
//! drum MIDI ([`GRID_FROM_MIDI`]) — and every quantize after reads them.
//! The kit's live on its folder (`Drums`) and count for every track under
//! it.
//!
//! Kept as the track's own data (`fts.marks` in its extension state):
//! saved with the song, in REAPER's project too, and in the project
//! document — an undo takes them back with everything else.
