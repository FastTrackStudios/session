//! Opening a song: THE one way, on every target.
//!
//! Which file opens (the prepared `.session`, else the `.RPP` prepared once
//! and saved), whether it is prepared, its project text, and loading it
//! into an engine. Everything here reads through a [`Folder`] — this
//! machine's disk ([`crate::folder::Disk`], what the plain functions use)
//! or a browser's memory ([`crate::folder::Memory`], a song from a share
//! link) — so a song opens the same way wherever its bytes are. The native
//! bootstrap (the runtime, the facade, the audio device) is
//! [`crate::open`]'s, which re-exports all of this.
