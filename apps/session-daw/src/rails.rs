//! The toolbars down the sides and across the top.
//!
//! Three rails frame a view: one on the left, one on the right, one
//! across the top. They are the same three in the arrangement and in
//! the mixer, because a window that moved its toolbars when you pressed
//! `x` would be two applications wearing one title bar.
//!
//! What goes IN them differs, and that is the point: the left rail says
//! where you are, the right says how this view behaves, the top carries
//! the things that act on the session as a whole. In the mixer the left
//! rail is the mix phases — Rescue through Overview — so the panel
//! always answers "which pass is this" without being asked.
//!
//! # Why the rails own the frame
//!
//! The panel inside them is recorded once and replayed under a
//! transform. The rails are not: they are a handful of shapes that
//! change when a setting changes, which is orders of magnitude rarer
//! than a frame and orders of magnitude cheaper than a strip. So they
//! are drawn live, over the panel, and the panel is told to cull to the
//! space between them — [`Frame::content`].
