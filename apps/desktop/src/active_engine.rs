//! Whichever backend is actually running — Live Mode's in-process player
//! ([`crate::session_engine`]) or Recording Mode's live REAPER connection
//! ([`crate::reaper_engine`]) — reduced to the one thing the performance
//! view needs from either: a `SetlistService` client pair.
//!
//! Everything else session-desktop does with an engine (Live's
//! "Load & Play", the keyflow toolbar's direct `.standalone` dispatch) is
//! Live-Mode-only and keeps calling `session_engine::engine()` directly —
//! those actions have no meaning against real REAPER, which owns that
//! state itself.
