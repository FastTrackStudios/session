//! The UIScene lifecycle, which iOS 27 requires of every app — and the
//! little else of UIKit the app reaches for itself ([`open_url`],
//! [`pasted`]).
//!
//! An app built with the iOS 27 SDK that does not adopt scenes is stopped at
//! launch (`_UIApplicationEvaluateRuntimeIssueForNoSceneLifecycleAdoption`
//! traps). winit — what Blitz draws into — does not adopt them yet
//! (rust-windowing/winit#4224): it makes its `UIWindow` the pre-scene way,
//! and a window with no scene is never shown.
//!
//! So the app adopts them itself: `Info.plist` names this delegate for the
//! application role (`UIApplicationSceneManifest`, written by the iOS build
//! scripts), and winit's window is given the app's scene — sized to its
//! screen and made key — as soon as both exist, whichever comes second: the
//! scene connecting (the delegate) or the window being made
//! ([`window_created`], from the shell, with winit's view). A scene-based
//! app's `UIApplication.windows` lists only windows that have a scene, so
//! the window has to be handed over rather than found. winit goes on driving
//! it as before; only whose scene it is changes.
