//! Recording Mode — drive a real, running REAPER instead of playing the
//! setlist ourselves.
//!
//! Live Mode ([`crate::session_engine`]) embeds a `daw-standalone` backend
//! and plays the setlist's audio itself. Recording Mode is the same
//! `SetlistService` wire surface — same `SetlistServiceClient` type, same
//! `session_ui::Session::init` call, same performance view — just dialed
//! at a REAPER extension's `SetlistServiceImpl<daw_reaper::Reaper>`
//! instead of an in-process one. `fts-extensions` already mounts that
//! service (`session::daw_services::layer_services_with_daw`) — along
//! with every other `daw::service` trait `Reaper` implements, via
//! `Reaper.into_router()` — onto the `LayerRouter` its REAPER-hosted
//! `daw-reaper` publishes over a local Unix-domain-socket vox link
//! (`/tmp/fts-daw-{pid}.sock`).
//!
//! Two client connections share that one socket, opened separately
//! because they need different client types:
//! - [`daw::cli`] (already-written REAPER launcher + socket discovery +
//!   the generic `Projects`/`Tracks`/etc. surface) handles "find or
//!   launch REAPER" and "open each song's project".
//! - This module's own [`connect`] opens the `SetlistService` lanes
//!   directly — `daw::cli`'s `Daw` type doesn't expose those (they're
//!   session's own services, not core `daw` ones).
//!
//! No audio thread here: REAPER is the one making sound.
